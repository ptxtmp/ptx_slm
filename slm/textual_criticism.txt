Preface

Students often ask, “Is the Bible we have today accurate?” or “How accurate is
the  biblical  text?” A  response  is  almost  impossible  without  discussing  ques-
tions of textual criticism. This book is written to provide both the basics of tex-
tual criticism and the background needed to answer questions regarding the
accuracy of the Bible. In my experience of teaching biblical Greek, Hebrew and
Bible  introduction  courses,  students  repeatedly  ﬁnd  textual  criticism  in  both
the Old and New Testaments difﬁcult to understand. Several scholarly books
discuss in detail the process and technical problems of textual criticism. More
recently several simpliﬁed works have also appeared on either Old Testament
or New Testament textual criticism. This book, however, is a practical, step-by-
step approach for the beginning student and layperson who wishes to have a
broad working knowledge of both Old and New Testament textual criticism. 
Questions of textual criticism are often ﬁrst encountered simply by reading
the notations “some ancient versions read . . .” or “some of the oldest manu-
scripts do not contain these verses” that appear in the margins of various mod-
ern Bible translations. For example:

1 Samuel 6:19 (Hebrew Bible). “And He struck down the men of Bethshemesh be-
cause they looked into the Ark of the LORD and He struck down the people 50,070
men and the people mourned because the LORD struck down the people with a
great slaughter.”

In this case the phrase in italics (“50,070 men”) is translated as “70 men” in
several of the modern translations (e.g., NIV, NRSV, NLT, ESV). However, many
Hebrew  manuscripts  and  ancient  versions  (e.g.,  Septuagint  [hereafter  LXX],
Latin  Vulgate,  Syriac  Peshitta)  contain  the  reading  “50,070  men.”  Modern
translations, therefore, deal with this passage differently:

NIV:

“seventy men.” Note: “A few Hebrew manuscripts; most Hebrew manu-
scripts and Septuagint 50,070.”

NASB: “50,070 men.” No note.

NLT:  “seventy men.” Note: “As in a few Hebrew manuscripts; most Hebrew
manuscripts and Greek versions read 50,070 men. Perhaps the text should
be understood to read the Lord killed 70 men and 50 oxen.”

NRSV:  “seventy men.” Note: “Heb killed seventy men, ﬁfty thousand men.”

A   S T U D E N T ’ S   G U I D E   T O   T E X T U A L   C R I T I C I S M   O F   T H E   B I B L E

The question is, How many people were actually killed after looking into
the ark? The majority of Hebrew manuscripts and the Greek text record 50,070.
Why then do several modern translations say that only 70 men were killed?
Which reading is correct? 

Luke 11:4. “And forgive us our sins, as we ourselves also forgive those who are
indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.”

Some translators believe the last sentence should be similar to that found in
the Lord’s Prayer as recorded in Matthew 6:9-13 and thus add the phrase “but
deliver us from evil [or the evil one].” Once again, modern translations handle
this in a variety of ways:

NIV:

“and lead us not into temptation.” Note: “Some manuscripts  temptation
but deliver us from the evil one.” 

NASB: “And lead us not into temptation.” No note.

NLT:

“and lead us not into temptation.” Note: “Some manuscripts add addi-
tional portions of the Lord’s Prayer as it reads in Matt 6:9-13.”

NRSV: “and lead us not into temptation.” Note: “Other ancient authorities add

but rescue us from the evil one (or from evil).”

These  differences  and  their  notations  often  confuse  the  reader  and  raise
questions regarding the accuracy of the text. This book discusses these issues
and is speciﬁcally directed to someone who is new to the ﬁeld of textual criti-
cism or who is having difﬁculty understanding this area. It is intended to be a
guide, introducing the reader to the questions, processes and tools of textual
criticism.  For  the  student  who  wishes  to  proceed  further,  bibliographies  for
each area of textual criticism are also included.

The scriptural citations are my own translations of the Biblia Hebraica Stutt-
gartensia (1984) or the United Bible Societies’ The Greek New Testament (4th rev.
ed.), unless otherwise noted.

I wish to thank Dr. Michael W. Holmes for reading a preliminary draft of
the chapters on New Testament textual criticism. A special thanks also to Joe
Gordon, Diane Hakala and Mitch Miller for their varied assistance during the
writing process, and to my wife, Cathy, for reading over several preliminary
drafts of this book.

Introduction to Textual Criticism

This chapter sets forth the aim of this book and the deﬁnition, purpose, goal
and importance of textual criticism. It describes the differences between Old
Testament and New Testament textual criticism and deﬁnes the term variant
reading.

The job of the textual critic is very similar to that of a detective searching
for clues as to the original reading of the text. It is reminiscent of the master
detective Sherlock Holmes who could determine a number of characteris-
tics of the suspect from the slightest of clues left at the crime scene. In our
case the “crime scene” is the biblical text, and often we have far fewer clues
to  work  from  than  we  would  like.  Yet  the  job  of  the  textual  critic  is  ex-
tremely important, for we are trying to determine the exact reading of a text
in  order  to  know  what  God  has  said  and  expects  from  us.  This  book  de-
scribes the basic principles involved in the process of determining the most
reliable reading of the text. Let’s begin our journey with a deﬁnition of tex-
tual criticism.

1.1 Deﬁnition of Textual Criticism

It can be difﬁcult for today’s student, who photocopies, sends faxes and reads
hundreds  of  pages  for  assignments,  to  appreciate  how  painstaking  a  task  it
was to copy a book before the introduction of movable type. In reading any
version of the Bible today, it is essential to understand that its books under-
went many centuries of hand copying before the appearance of the printing
press in the ﬁfteenth century A.D.

Unfortunately no original manuscripts (called “autographs”) of any of the
biblical  books  have  been  recovered,  and  since  no  extant  manuscripts  agree
with each other in every detail, textual criticism is necessary to resolve ques-
tions of variation. Alfred E. Housman, a text critic of classical works, observes

that textual criticism is based on
“common  sense  and  the  use  of
reason.”1  Brieﬂy  stated,  textual
criticism is the science and art that
seeks to determine the most reliable
wording  of  a  text.2  It  is  a  science
because  speciﬁc  rules  govern
the  evaluation  of  various  types
of  copyist  errors  and  readings,
but it is also an art because these
rules  cannot  rigidly  be  applied
in every situation. Intuition and
common  sense  must  guide  the
process of determining the most
Informed
reading. 
plausible 
judgments  about  a  text  depend
on  one’s  familiarity  with  the
types  of  copyist  errors,  manu-
scripts,  versions  and  their  au-
thors.  It  is  a  complex  process
with few shortcuts, but one that
can be learned through system-
atic effort. 

Figure 1.1 A scribe at work. At the end of an Ar-
menian manuscript of the Gospels, a scribe de-
scribes  his  hard-working  conditions,  saying
that his ink had frozen and that his ﬁngers were
still  stiff  due  to  the  cold  of  the  snowstorm
(Bruce  M.  Metzger,  The  Text  of  the  New  Testa-
ment,  3rd  ed.  [New  York:  Oxford  University
Press, 1992], p. 18). Another scribe graphically
describes  the  harsh  effects  of  his  painstaking
job:  “Writing  bows  the  back,  thrusts  the  ribs
into one’s stomach, and fosters a general debil-
ity of the body” (Ibid., pp. 17-18). [Bibliothèque
nationale de France]

1.2 Importance of Textual Criticism

The importance of textual criticism is threefold. First and foremost, it at-
tempts to establish the most reliable reading of the text. Second, in cases
where a deﬁnitive reading is impossible to determine, it can help to avoid
dogmatism. Third, it can help the reader better understand the signiﬁcance
of marginal readings that appear in various Bible translations. Textual crit-
icism is not a matter of making negative comments or observations about
the biblical text; instead it is the process of searching through the various
sources of the biblical texts to determine the most accurate or reliable read-
ing of a particular passage. It can, in fact, actually lead to increased conﬁ-
dence in the reliability of the biblical texts. Bruce K. Waltke notes that in the
Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (the most recent critical edition of the Hebrew

Bible; hereafter BHS) approximately one textual note appears for every ten
words; thus 90 percent of the text is without signiﬁcant variation.3 Accord-
ing to Shemaryahu Talmon, even the errors and textual variations that exist
“affect the intrinsic message only in relatively few instances.”4 Similarly in
the New Testament, the fourth edition of the United Bible Societies’ (here-
after UBS) Greek New Testament text notes variants regarding approximately
500 out of 6,900 words, or only about seven percent of the text.5 Textual crit-
icism, therefore, mainly concerns itself with this small portion of the bibli-
cal  text  called  “variant  readings.” A  variant  reading  is  any  difference  in
wording (e.g., differences in spelling, added or omitted words) that occurs
among manuscripts.

Sir  Frederic  Kenyon  (d.  August  1952),  a  renowned  New  Testament  text
critic of the twentieth century, summarized the overall favorable result of New
Testament textual criticism:

It is reassuring at the end to ﬁnd that the general result of all these discoveries
and all this study is to strengthen the proof of the authenticity of the Scriptures,
and our conviction that we have in our hands, in substantial integrity, the verita-
ble Word of God.6

Many things have changed in the area of textual criticism over the last ﬁve
decades since Kenyon. Further examination of the manuscripts from the Dead
Sea area have revolutionized the study of Old Testament textual criticism, and
more Greek manuscripts or fragments are now available for New Testament
studies  (i.e.,  manuscripts  from  St.  Catherine’s  Monastery  presently  number
301; one of the newest manuscripts published, â116, is a fragment of Hebrews
2:9-11 and 3:3-6).7 Even though we have more evidence today than any previ-
ous generation, the issues of textual criticism have become more complex than
ever. Still there are relatively few signiﬁcant variants in the Bible, and among
these variants there is very little difference in meaning and content. To help
put this into perspective it is commonly said that no theological doctrine or is-

the various English translations of the New Testament than among the Greek
manuscripts.9

1.3 Differences Between Old Testament and New Testament Textual 
Criticism

Old Testament textual criticism differs from New Testament textual criticism
for  two  principal  reasons:  (1)  the  time  period  during  which  Old  Testament
manuscripts were copied is much greater, and (2) they have different starting
points. It is no surprise that the history of transmission for the Old Testament
is much longer than the New Testament’s, but there are also other issues that
make their histories signiﬁcantly different. 

1.3.1 Old Testament Transmissional History

If Moses, traditionally dated to the ﬁfteenth century B.C., wrote any of the bib-
lical texts, then some Old Testament texts may have been copied for over three
thousand years.10 The earliest extant copy of any part of the Old Testament is
of two verses from the book of Numbers inscribed on silver amulets dated to
the seventh century  B.C. (see pp. 140-42). The next oldest texts, dated to the
third  century  B.C.,  come  from  the  Dead  Sea  area  (e.g.,  4QSamb  [4Q52]  and
4QJera [4Q70]).11 There are very few extant, early manuscripts or fragments of
the Old Testament, but in contrast, there are about ninety-three manuscripts or
manuscript fragments of the New Testament that are dated within three hun-
dred years after the New Testament was written.12 This does not even take into
account the numerous quotations from early church fathers. 

Until 1947 one of the oldest, accessible complete Hebrew manuscripts was
Codex  Leningradensis  (Leningrad  Public  Library  Ms.  B  19A),  dated  to  A.D.
1008, though portions of other biblical books were available from possibly 100
to 150 years earlier (e.g., British Museum Codex OR. 4445 [of the Pentateuch;
dated to about A.D. 820-850]; Codex Cairensis [dated to about A.D. 895]).13 But

DEAD SEA SCROLLS
Since 1947 at least 900 manuscripts have been found in caves along the
western shore of the Dead Sea. The largest number of these manuscripts
were at a site commonly known as Qumran, leading them to be referred to
as the Qumran scrolls. From Cave 4 came over 500 documents, many of
which were either simply fragments or unreadable (see ﬁg. 1.2). The manu-
scripts are generally dated between 250 B.C. to A.D. 135. About one quar-
ter are portions of biblical texts.a Some of the biblical books were repre-
sented by a great number of copies (e.g., the book of Isaiah had twenty-one
different  manuscripts),  whereas  Esther  and  possibly  Nehemiah  were  not
represented at all. It is uncertain whether the omission of the books of Esther
and Nehemiah was intentional or accidental.b

aJames C. VanderKam, The Dead Sea Scrolls Today (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1994),
p. 31.
bMost scholars believe that Ezra and Nehemiah were considered one book at this time
based on the following information: (1) In Contra Apion 1:8 (dated to A.D. 93-95) Jo-
sephus states there are twenty-two canonical books. (2) Jubilees 2:23 refers to twenty-
two canonical books (dated between 170-140 B.C.). (3) 4 Ezra 14:44-46 says there are
twenty-four canonical books (dated to the ﬁrst century A.D.). In order to arrive at twenty-
two  canonical  books  we  must  combine  the  following  books:  (1)  Judges  and  Ruth,
(2) 1-2 Samuel, (3) 1-2 Kings, (4) Jeremiah and Lamentations, (5) the Twelve Minor
Prophets (generally called The Book of the Twelve), (6) Ezra and Nehemiah, and (7)
1-2 Chronicles. To achieve twenty-four canonical books Judges and Ruth as well as Jer-
emiah and Lamentations are considered separate books.

in the middle of the twentieth century things began to change and the number
of early manuscripts of the Old Testament increased signiﬁcantly, largely due
to  the  discovery  of  manuscripts  in  the  Judean  Desert  (commonly  called  the
Dead Sea Scrolls). 

The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls revolutionized the ﬁeld of Old Testa-
ment  textual  criticism  because  for  the  ﬁrst  time  Hebrew  manuscripts  (or  at
least fragments) from at least as early as the ﬁrst century B.C. were available for
most of the Old Testament.14 Nevertheless, most of the earliest extant Hebrew
manuscripts are still a signiﬁcant distance from the autographs of the Old Tes-
tament.

Not  only  is  there  a  signiﬁcant  difference  in  the  number  of  early  manu-
scripts but also the transmissional history is different. Throughout the his-
tory of the Old Testament the Israelites appear to have had a group of scribes

or  priests  dedicated  to  the  job  of  preserving  and  maintaining  their  sacred
Scriptures. This was often not the case for the New Testament manuscripts
since the Christian church was persecuted during much of its early history,
and  manuscript  copies  made  by  professional  scribes  were  very  expensive.
Many early New Testament manuscripts were copied by believers who de-
sired to have their own copy of these precious works. Thus there are more
manuscripts  from  this  early  trans-
missional period of the New Testa-
ment,  though  they  may  also  be
more  ﬂawed  since  they  were  not
made  by  professional  scribes.
Sometimes  they  only  had  a  few
verses  written  on  whatever  mate-
rial  was  available  (e.g.,  potsherds,

1.3.2 Different Starting Points

Largely because of the lack of early Old Testament manuscripts (in contrast to
the plethora of New Testament manuscripts) and the differences in the trans-
missional process between the Old and New Testament manuscripts, the text
critics  of  each  of  the  testaments  have  been  led  to  different  starting  points.
James Barr explains it well:

With a non-uniform text [e.g., the New Testament] we may ﬁnd variant readings,
and textual discussion begins from the variant readings, even if all of them “make
sense.” With a text of high uniformity [e.g., the Old Testament], however, textual
discussion will more frequently begin from the feeling that there is a “difﬁculty”;
the procedure will be more independent of the existence of variant readings.15

This makes the task of Old Testament text critics more subjective than that
of their New Testament counterparts. P. Kyle McCarter notes the additional
difﬁculty that a text may be corrupt even though it remains clear and easy to
understand:

A  copyist  who  inadvertently  strays  from  his  text  is  much  more  likely  to  write
something  familiar  to  himself—something  he  frequently  writes—than  some-
thing unfamiliar. It is the nature of scribal error that it tends to produce the ordi-
nary, commonplace, or “easy” reading. Corrupt texts, therefore, very often read
quite smoothly.16

This leads us to our next question, namely, what is the goal or aim of textual

criticism?

1.4 Goal of Textual Criticism

Since no autographs are available today of either the Old or New Testaments,
the general task of the text critic is to get back as close as possible to those au-
tographs. This is no easy task, for textual criticism is also affected by higher-
critical matters, such as how and when a text reached its ﬁnal form. 

1.4.1 Goal of Old Testament Textual Criticism

It is difﬁcult to know when the composition of a biblical book was completed
and the transmission of the text began. This is complicated further by the pos-
sibility  that  these  two  processes  may  overlap  to  some  extent.  It  was  once
thought possible to recover the ipsissima verbs (“actual words”) of the inspired
writer and that these were the original autographs of Scripture. However, today
most scholars recognize that it is impossible to trace the formation of any of the

Old Testament books and that most have undergone later modiﬁcations.17 Just
three examples will sufﬁce to indicate that even the most conservative scholars
must allow for some modiﬁcation of the original texts. (1) In Genesis 14:14, the
city of Laish (Judg 18:29), or Leshem (Josh 19:47), is called “Dan” before its name
was ever changed to “Dan,” and no manuscript evidence suggests a different
reading.18  It  is  most  likely  that  an  editor  later  changed  it  so  that  his  readers
would understand which city was being indicated. (2) Deuteronomy 34 records
the death of Moses, and verse 10 even states that “since that time [i.e., the death
of Moses] no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses,” which implies that this
chapter must have been written sometime after Moses’ death. Jewish tradition
holds that Joshua wrote this chapter.19 Others suggest a Deuteronomistic edi-
tor.20 But when was it added to the rest of Deuteronomy? Because all of the He-
brew manuscripts contain this chapter, it must have been added fairly early and
then maintained by the scribes. (3) The phrase “and within yet sixty-ﬁve years
Ephraim will be shattered from being a people” in Isaiah 7:8 has puzzled schol-
ars for years since it does not appear to ﬁt the context, even though its informa-
tion is correct. Esarhaddon (680-669 B.C.) or Ashurbanipal (= Osnappar, 669-627
B.C.) came through approximately sixty-ﬁve years after the time of Isaiah 7 and
deported more people from Israel (cf. Ezra 4:2, 9-10).21 The most likely explana-
tion is that this phrase was added by an editor or copyist sometime later (per-
haps when these events happened), but once again no textual evidence suggests
that this phrase was a later addition to the text. Since these parts appear in all the
extant Hebrew manuscripts and ancient versions, they must have been put into
the  text  fairly  early  and  apparently  were  part  of  the  authoritative  text  main-
tained by the scribes. Thus our understanding of the ﬁnal form of the text must
include at least these types of modiﬁcations of the text.

Table 1.1. Perceived Goals of Old Testament Textual Criticism

Goal

Description

Scholars

1. Restore the origi-
nal composition 

The goal is to recover the author’s ipsissima 
verba, “to establish the text as the author 
wished to have it presented to the public.”

Most older textual 
critics, Harrisona

2. Restore the ﬁnal 
form of the text 
(most modern tex-
tual critics)

The goal is to recover the ipsissima verba of 
the ﬁnal redactor, assuming that the book 
has gone through some evolutionary process 
to get to this ﬁnal form.

Brotzman,b Deist,c 
Würthweind

3. Restore the earli-
est attested form

The goal is to recover the earliest attested 
form of the text for which there are actual 
textual witnesses. Generally the text in view 
is from the second century B.C., and conjec-
tural emendations are not allowed.

Bible Project, UBS

ment Text Project

4. Restore accepted 
texts (plural)

The goal is to recover the texts as they were 
accepted by particular religious communi-
ties. Each text may differ according to the 
authoritative standard of its particular com-
munity. 

James Sanders, 
Brevard Childs 
(though he centers 
on the MT text 
accepted by the Jews)

5. Restore ﬁnal texts 
(plural)

6. Restore all various 
“literary editions” of 
the Old Testament

The goal is to recover the ﬁnal form of the 
text. In some books or pericopes this may 
mean that there are several equally valid 
texts of the Old Testament that need to be 
restored.

The goal is not to just reproduce the MT, but 
to restore all the “literary editions” of the 
various writings that can be discerned in the 
evolution of the Hebrew Bible (e.g., the LXX, 
SP, MT, as well as all others represented at 
Qumran and other places).

“Thus the target of ‘textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible’ is not a single text. The purpose or function of 
textual criticism is to reconstruct the history of the texts that eventually become the biblical collection in 
both its literary growth and its scribal transmission; it is not just to judge individual variants in order to 
determine which were ‘superior’ or ‘original.’ The ‘original text’ is a distracting concept for the Hebrew 
Bible” (pp. 98-99).

Table 1.1 summarizes and augments the history of what scholars believe to
be  the  goal  of  Old  Testament  textual  criticism  as  described  in  an  article  by
Bruce K. Waltke.22 

1.4.1.1 Final form or forms of the Old Testament text. Several modern scholars
have adopted the goal of determining the ﬁnal form or the ﬁnal attested form
of the text,23 but even the ability to do this has been questioned. Both Emanuel
Tov and Bruce Waltke have argued that there may be several original forms of
a biblical text,24 an idea based primarily on divergent readings of parallel pas-
sages in the Old Testament (e.g., 2 Sam 22 // Ps 18; 2 Kings 18:13-20:19 // Is 36-
39; Is 2:2-4 // Mic 4:1-3; Ps 14 // Ps 53; Ps 40:13-17 [MT 14-18] // Ps 70) and the
existence of divergent manuscripts. Tov states:

These  parallel  sources  are  based  on  ancient  texts  which  already  differed  from
each other before they were incorporated into the biblical books, and which un-
derwent changes after they were transmitted from one generation to the next as
part of the biblical books. Hence, within the scope of the present analysis, these
parallel texts, which are found in all biblical witnesses, including Mà [MT], are of
particular interest. The differences between these parallel texts in Mà, as well as in
other texts, could reﬂect very ancient differences created in the course of the copy-
ing of the biblical text, similar to the differences known from a comparison of an-
cient scrolls and manuscripts.25

To  argue  for  two  separate  textual  traditions  based  on  the  differences  in
these parallel passages is only one of the possible answers. Table 1.2 examines
the differences in the text of the MT between Isaiah 2:2-4 and Micah 4:1-3 in
more detail.

Out of 272 consonants in Micah 4:1-3 there are only thirty that are different
from those in Isaiah 2:2-4, or about 11 percent of the letters. The differences be-
tween these consonants can be grouped in the following ways: several (12 con-
sonants) are different because the words are out of order; some (25 consonants)
use a different but similar word; one consonant adds a ﬁnal nu=n; one consonant
uses a plural verb instead of a singular, and one adds a whole phrase (11 con-
sonants). It is difﬁcult to know why these texts are so similar and yet contain
differences. These differences may indicate two original sources or one source

that has been intentionally modiﬁed or unintentionally corrupted resulting in
two distinct readings—either explanation is plausible,26 as is the case for many
of the parallel passages in the Hebrew Bible.27 But a problem like the LXX ver-
sion of the book of Jeremiah, which is arranged differently and is one-eighth
shorter than the MT, cannot be accounted for merely by different copyists of the
same text.28 A fragment of a scroll of the book of Jeremiah found at Qumran
(4QJerb [4Q71]) dated by paleography to the ﬁrst half of the second century B.C.
contains characteristics similar to the LXX,29 suggesting that there were differ-

known  how  the  different  versions  originated  or  if  they  were  both  seen  as
equally authoritative. Recent work on the shorter version of Job in the LXX has
suggested that in some cases the copyist/editor intentionally shortened a He-
brew text similar to the proto-MT in order to make it more appealing to his Hel-
lenistic audience.31 Is it also possible that early Jews in Alexandria used the LXX
because they could understand the Greek, but they knew that the Hebrew text
behind it was the more authoritative text?

1.4.1.2 Fluidity of the Old Testament text. It appears that the Old Testament
text  was  somewhat  ﬂuid  (or  subject  to  change)  until  about  the  ﬁrst  century
A.D., as seen in the increasing number of matres lectionis (i.e., letters used to in-
dicate vowels to aid in pronunciation of the text) added by the scribes, the in-
terchange of similar words and the various forms of the text in existence by the
second century B.C. One reasonable explanation for the addition of matres lec-
tionis is that following the return from the Babylonian Exile the Jews needed
extra help in understanding Hebrew since they had grown accustomed to Ar-
amaic (e.g., see Nehemiah 8:8; 13:24). Following the Exile, when there were
multiple sites of worship and learning for the Jews (i.e., Babylon and Pales-
tine), it is plausible that variants of the Hebrew text may have developed be-
cause it was harder to keep strict control over the copying of Scripture.

However, any amount of ﬂuidity makes the text critic’s task more difﬁcult

MATRES LECTIONIS
Certain Hebrew consonants (i.e., primarily h [h] = “a” vowel, w [w] = “o”
or “u” vowels, and y [y] = “e” or “i” vowels) were added to the text in order
to indicate a vowel sound. Vowel points were not inserted in the Hebrew
text until about A.D. 500-800, and continued to be added to the text until
about A.D. 1000; they have been used to determine the date of certain
texts. For example, the proto-MT has fewer matres lectionis than most of
the manuscripts from Qumran and thus the Qumran texts are generally
dated after the text of the proto-MT. The following example illustrates the
differences:
Isaiah 40:1 (supposed proto-MT)  MMMMkkkkyyyyhhhhllll))))    rrrrmmmm))))yyyy    yyyymmmm((((    wwwwmmmmxxxxnnnn    wwwwmmmmxxxxnnnn

The texts above are alike except where matres lectionis are included to
help indicate which vowel to use, even where the ﬁnal letter is added to
show the pronominal sufﬁx should be pronounced (e.g., kema, not kem).
Note the arrows above point out the matres lectionis that have been added
to the text.

since there are more options to choose from (i.e., it is hard to determine the ear-
liest form of a text if it continued to change). 

In one sense an established text makes the text critic’s task easier because
there is a standard against which to judge, as was the case from about the ﬁrst
to the ﬁfteenth centuries A.D. But the problem with a uniﬁed text is that earlier
and possibly even more accurate variations may have been removed by those
who determined which text to retain. Is it possible then to determine a form of
the Old Testament text that preceded the form in the ﬁrst century A.D.? In some
cases, yes, as the following illustration indicates. 

The BHS of Genesis 4:8 can be translated very literally as: “And Cain said
to Abel his brother, and when they were in the ﬁeld then Cain rose up over
Abel his brother and killed him.” An obvious element missing from this verse
is  what  Cain  said  to  Abel.  Several  ancient  versions  or  recensions  (SP;  LXX;
Peshitta; Vulgate), as well as some Hebrew manuscripts include the phrase,

“And Cain said to Abel his brother, 
and it came about when they were in

his brother and killed him.”

Some Hebrew Manuscripts; SP; LXX; Peshitta; 
Vulgate

Each version has a reading similar to: “And 
Cain said to Abel his brother, ‘Let us go out into 
the ﬁeld’; and it came about when they were in 
the ﬁeld then Cain rose up over Abel his 
brother and killed him.”

“Let us go out into the ﬁeld,” which appears to be necessary for the meaning
of the text. These sources may have included this phrase to smooth out the
translation. However, it seems more reasonable that originally the phrase was
in the text, but at some point in the copying process it was omitted from the
MT (i.e., BHS; possibly because the eye of the scribe jumped from wyxi)f right to
yhiy:wa both of which have several similar consonants). 

1.4.1.3 A complex goal. Although evidence of the earliest stages of the trans-
mission of the Old Testament is extremely scarce, it is nevertheless a reason-
able  goal  to  attempt  to  determine  the  earliest  form  of  the  canonical  text.32
Waltke urges Old Testament text critics to “resist the temptation to lower their
sights from the high ideal of recovering ﬁnal text(s) that emerged in Israel be-
fore prophecy ceased in Israel.”33 It is appropriate to ask which of the texts we
know to have existed before the ﬁrst century A.D. (e.g., Dead Sea Scrolls, LXX,
SP) most likely reﬂect the original form of the Hebrew text. For example, did
Deuteronomy 27:4 originally contain a prescription of worship at Mt. Ebal as
the MT states or at Mt. Gerizim as the SP has it?34 Is the MT correct in saying that
the Israelites spent 430 years in Egypt (Exodus 12:40) or are the LXX and SP cor-
rect  that  this  period  included  the  time  spent  in  both  Egypt  and  Canaan?
Waltke concludes his discussion on the aim of Old Testament textual criticism
as follows:

The text critic’s aim will vary according to the nature of the book. If a book had

32Tov currently argues that the preferred goal of Old Testament textual criticism is: “to aim at
the one text or different texts which was (were) accepted as authoritative in (an) earlier pe-
riod(s)” (Textual Criticism, p. 288).

33Waltke, “Aims of Old Testament Textual Criticism,” p. 101. 
34There is no question that differing theological considerations affected the reading of this
passage. See James A. Montgomery, The Samaritans: The Earliest Jewish Sect (Philadelphia:
Winston, 1907), p. 35.

but one author, then the critic will aim to restore his original composition; if it be
an edited text, then he will seek to recover the ﬁnal, canonical text. If he turns up
more than one ﬁnal text, he will turn his data over to the literary and canonical
critic to determine whether the text is in process of developing into a ﬁnal canon-
ical text or whether it existed in more than one canonical form.35

What  I  take  issue  with  in  Waltke’s  statement  is  whether  there  ever  was
more than one authoritative form of the text. A biblical book may have gone
through  some  modiﬁcation  on  its  way  to  its  ﬁnal,  authoritative  form,  and
there may be times when we can identify these changes (e.g., “Dan” in Gene-
sis 14:14; Isaiah 7:8b), but the goal of the Old Testament text critic is to deter-
mine the ﬁnal, authoritative form, which then was maintained by the scribes
and  was  later  recorded  in  the  canon.
This  position  assumes  Adam  van  der
Woude’s  contention  that  there  has  al-
ways  been  a  relative  “uniformity”  of
the textual tradition in the religious cir-
cles around the temple, even amidst the
“plurality”  that  developed  before  the
turn of the century.36 This goal pushes
to an even earlier period than Waltke’s
phrase  “if  it  be  an  edited  text  then  he
will seek to recover the ﬁnal, canonical
text” (which we assume he dates about
300 B.C.). The ﬁnal form of the text that
later became canonical may not be ob-
tainable in every case, nevertheless it is
a plausible goal in the vast majority of
the  cases  (over  90  percent),  especially
given the number of materials discov-
ered in the twentieth century.

of some of the New Testament books? Or did Paul make multiple copies of
some of his letters?37 Eldon Jay Epp provides several lines of evidence that he
believes may point in the direction of multiple forms of New Testament books
(he calls this multivalence of the original texts): (1) our present Gospels used
preexisting  sources  or  precanonical  versions,  (2)  some  have  suggested  that
the book of Acts has come down to us in two differing textual streams, and
(3) the doxology in Romans 16:25-27 appears in some manuscripts in Romans
14:23, causing some scholars to suggest that the book may have had a shorter
and a longer form.38 However, whether this is enough evidence to posit mul-
tiple forms of the biblical text is questionable, and it has the appearance of an
endless hunt for supposed sources, as has been the case with Pentateuchal
source criticism. 

Bart Ehrman takes a somewhat different direction and suggests that when
an early scribe changed a text to provide a more orthodox theological view-
point,  he  may  then  have  created  a  new  original  text.39  This  raises  several
questions: What happens if the new alteration becomes popularly accepted
by the church as the more authoritative text? Is the other virtually lost except
as a variant of the text? Do we have two original texts? Ehrman raises a plau-
sible viewpoint, but we have very little evidence that the early church was
trying to fortify theological positions rather than trying to maintain an accu-
rate  text.  There  is,  in  fact,  a  somewhat  similar  example  in  1  Timothy  3:16,
where the Greek word o#v, “he, or the one who is,” has been changed to qeo/v,
“God,” making the text much stronger theologically. However, the editors of
the UBS Greek text suggest (based at least partially on the manuscript evi-
dence) that this theologically stronger variant is a later reading. Ehrman and
others suggest that these changes were made very early in the transmission
of the text. While it is difﬁcult to know what happened in the ﬁrst hundred
years  of  the  history  of  transmission,  there  is  little  convincing  evidence  for
such changes. The early church seems to have taken great care to monitor er-

rant theology and their sacred texts (e.g., their controversies with Gnostics,
docetists and Marcion). To give some idea of the authority and reverence that
these sacred words engendered, one need only look at quotations from the
early church fathers. For example, in a letter to the Corinthians (c. 95), Clem-
ent  of  Rome  states:  “Take  up  the  epistle  of  the  blessed  Paul  the Apostle”
(1 Clement 47:1),40 which implies that they had in their possession an author-
itative letter from Paul.

Other scholars have also questioned the accuracy of the transmission pro-
cess in the ﬁrst century of the church. Helmut Koester states that “whatever
evidence there is indicates that not only minor, but also substantial revisions
of the original texts have occurred during the ﬁrst hundred years of the trans-
mission.”41 Some even argue that the text should not be viewed as a ﬁxed au-
tograph  but  rather  as  a  “moving  stream”42  or  a  “living  text.”43  Surely  these
views overstate the case, whereas the traditional view has much to substanti-
ate it. While questions as to the original text surface in some places, a substan-
tial amount of the New Testament text remains unquestioned and most likely
represents the text of the original autographs or very close to it. While the writ-
ers of New Testament Scriptures were still alive it is unlikely that people could
have changed their writings without their authors pointing out such discrep-
ancies.  Paul  sometimes  requested  that  his  letters  be  circulated  to  other
churches (Col 4:16), and thus the autographs must have been copied almost
immediately;  this  would  make  it  unlikely  that  others  could  modify  the  text
without some traces of the originals existing. The early church also had a great
reverence for these works (2 Tim 3:16; 2 Pet 1:20-21) and their authors (2 Pet
3:15-16), so it is doubtful that they would change their writings (see also Rev
22:18-19).

1.4.2.2 The goal. A plausible goal for New Testament textual criticism is the
recovery of the original readings of the text or in some cases it may be neces-
sary to identify the earliest possible readings.44 It may not always be possible
to know for certain that we have an original reading, but remember there is
only about 6 percent of the Greek text that is in question. Bruce M. Metzger
states it this way:

Although in very many cases the textual critic is able to ascertain without resid-
ual doubt which reading must have stood in the original, there are not a few other
cases where he can come only to a tentative decision based on an equivocal bal-
ancing of probabilities. Occasionally none of the variant readings will commend
itself as original, and he will be compelled either to choose the reading which he
judges to be the least unsatisfactory or to indulge in conjectural emendation. In
textual criticism, as in other areas of historical research, one must seek not only
to learn what can be known, but also to become aware of what, because of con-
ﬂicting witnesses, cannot be known.45 

In some cases New Testament manuscripts date to within ﬁfty to one hun-
dred years after their autographs. For example, Rylands Papyrus 457 (â52) is

ABUNDANCE OF MANUSCRIPTS

There  are  over  5,400  manuscripts  of  New  Testament  passages  and
books.a By comparison there are relatively few manuscripts of other an-
cient writings, as noted below:

Thucydides, History of the
Peloponnesian War (c. 460-400 
B.C.) 

Only 8 extant mss, the earliest being 
c. A.D. 900, plus a few fragments 
from the 1st century A.D.

Julius Caesar, Gallic War
(composed 58-50 B.C.)

Livy, Annals of the Roman People 
(59 B.C.-A.D. 17)

Tacitus, Histories and Annals
(c. A.D. 100)   

Several extant mss, but only 9 or 10 
of good quality; the oldest is about 
900 years after Julius Caesar.

Only 35 of the original 142 books 
have survived; 20 extant mss; only 1 
ms (containing fragments of books 
3-6) is as old as the fourth century 
A.D.

Only 4.5 of the original 14 books of 
Histories and 10 (with portions of 2 
more) of the 16 books of Annals sur-
vived in 2 mss dating from the ninth 
and eleventh centuries A.D.

thought to be dated to about A.D. 125 to 150, and the Gospel of John ranges
anywhere from A.D. 40 to 110;46 the interval between its authorship and extant
manuscript  evidence  is  thus  very  short.  Given  the  reverence  that  the  early
church had for the New Testament and its authors, it would seem that they
would try to maintain it as accurately as possible. 

The difﬁculty facing the New Testament text critic is weighing the numer-
ous copies of the New Testament books and their variant readings. Eldon J.
Epp explains how these variant readings may have originated:

An apostolic letter or a portion of a gospel would be read in a worship service;
visiting Christians now and again would make or secure copies to take to their
own congregations, or the church possessing it might send a copy to another con-
gregation at its own initiative or even at the request of the writer (cf. Col 4:16);
and quite rapidly numerous early Christian writings—predominately those that
eventually formed the NT—were to be found in church after church throughout
the Roman world. Naturally, the quality of each copy depended very much on
the circumstances of its production; some copies must have been made in a rather
casual manner under far less than ideal scribal conditions, while others, presum-
ably, were made with a measure of ecclesiastical sanction and ofﬁcial solicitude,
especially as time passed.47

The plethora of New Testament manuscripts is a great beneﬁt when trying
to determine the original reading of the New Testament, for it is easier to sift
through and evaluate the various extant readings than to emend texts with no
evidence. Therefore the goal of New Testament textual criticism is to deter-
mine the most plausible original reading out of a large body of evidence.

Transmissional Errors
Occurring in the Bible

This chapter describes types of errors that commonly occurred in the transmis-
sion of texts, with examples from Hebrew and Greek texts. It covers both unin-
tentional changes (homophony, haplography, dittography, etc.) and intentional
changes (substituting more common words for rare words, additions or glosses,
harmonization, etc.).

We have all carefully typed or hand copied written information only to ﬁnd in
checking it over that there are multiple mistakes. In a similar way the text of
the Bible has undergone centuries of hand copying by scribes who were prone
to human error. Even in the case of the Old Testament, where for a signiﬁcant
period of its textual history well-trained scribes copied the text following strict
precautionary rules, changes to the text were made, both unintentionally and
intentionally. The writing materials themselves sometimes facilitated errors;
most had rough surfaces on which the details of particular letters could be lost.
Greek and possibly Hebrew1 were written in scriptio continua (without breaks
between words), with little if any punctuation. It is important, therefore, in de-
termining the most plausible reading of a text to understand the types of errors
that may have been incorporated in the transmissional process.

2.1 Unintentional Changes

2.1.1 Mistaken letters

One of the most common errors made by copyists was the confusion of similar

letters. Just as in English u and v can sometimes look alike because of poor pen-
manship, so, for example, in Hebrew square script the d (d, da4let) and r (r, re=s])
may easily be confused. The Greek uncial letters C (sigma), O (omicron), and
Q (theta) can also sometimes look very similar. 

• Old Testament example. Genesis 10:4 cites a race known as the “Dodanim”
o, do4da4n|<m), but 1 Chronicles 1:7 calls them the “Rodanim” (Mynidfro,
(Mynidfd@
ro4da4n|<m). The name “Rodanim” is generally preferred as a reference to the
Rhodians of the Asia Minor coastline.2

• New Testament example. Some uncial manuscripts may have confused OC

(“the one who is” )*, A*) and QC (“God”; )

2, Ac ) in 1 Timothy 3:16.

2.1.2 Homophony 

The  substitution  of  similar
sounding  words.  In  English
“it’s” is often mistakenly writ-
ten  for  “its,”  or  “there”  for
“their.” Several Hebrew letters
(e.g.,  )  [)alep]  and  (  [(ayin],  t
[ta4w] and + [t[e=t], s [sa4mek] and
#& [s8|<n]) cannot be distinguished
by  sound  alone,  so  that  errors
of  homophony  could  have
been incorporated into the text
during  periods  of  oral  trans-
mission  or  when  one  person
read the text to several scribes
who transcribed it (which may
have  happened  at  Qumran).
Greek too has similar sounding
letters (e.g., a [alpha] and o [omicron], and o [omicron] and w [omega]).

• Old Testament example. In Isaiah 9:2 (ET 3) the word )Ol (lo4), “not”; “Thou
hast multiplied the nation, [and] not increased the joy” [KJV]) was appar-
ently incorrectly substituted for the word wOl  (lo=, “to him” or “to it”; “You
shall multiply the nation, You shall increase their gladness [lit. ‘gladness to
it’]” [NASB]). The Masoretes recognized the problematic negative particle in

this verse and noted in the Masorah parva (cf. pp. 109-10) that it should be
translated instead as wOl  (lo,=   “to it”). This change agrees with the Peshitta
and Targum Jonathan.

• New Testament example. There are two similar sounding readings of Ro-
1, B2, F, etc.) and e!xwmen (“we shall have”

mans 5:1— e!xomen (“we have” )
)*, A, B* , C, etc.).

2.1.3 Haplography

The  omission  of  a  letter  or
word, which is usually due to
a similar letter or word in the
context.  For 
instance,  “oc-
curence”  is  a  common  mis-
spelling  of  “occurrence.”  An
omission  can  easily  happen
when, in copying a text, one’s
eye  skips  ahead  to  another
word  or  line  with  the  same
word  or  letter.  This  tendency
is  compounded  when  there
are no spaces between words or punctuation marks, which certainly was the
case for Greek texts and may have been true of Hebrew as well. 

Figure  2.2.  Ancient  writing  materials.  Drawing
from an old Bible. [Paul D. Wegner]

• Old Testament example. People from the tribe of Benjamin are referred to
; (be6ne4 binya4min, “sons of Benjamin”) nine times out of ten in the
as NmiyFn:bi yn" b@
i (binya4min).
Old Testament, but in Judges 20:13 they are simply called NmiyFn:b@
The Masoretes apparently thought that the text suffered from haplography
;, be6ne4) without includ-
since they inserted pointing for the word “sons” (yn'b@
ing the consonants. 

As noted above the Masoretes, who maintained the Hebrew text from about
A.D. 500–1100, sometimes would make notations in the marginal Masorahs or
leave the text unpointed when they questioned it for some reason. Notice that
the second line merely has the vowel points for yn'b@

;, be6ne4 in the BHS text:

“‘Now, give up the men, the sons of Beliya(al (worthless fellows) who are in Gi-
beah, that we may kill them and remove (the) evil from Israel.’ But the sons of
Benjamin were not willing to listen to the voice of their brothers, the sons of Is-
rael.” (Judges 20:13)

• New Testament example. Some manuscripts of John 1:13 read e )genhqhsan
(P75,  A,  B*  ª  O)  while  others  read  e )gennh/qh  (itb,  Irenaeuslat,  Tertullian,
Origenlat 1/2 , etc.); both mean “were born” though they come from two differ-
ent roots, genna&w and gi &nomai, respectively.

The following pictures illustrate how difﬁcult it would be to copy some of

these early texts:

2.1.4 Dittography 

A letter or word that has been written twice rather than once. For example, in
English  latter  might  mistakenly  be  written  for  later.  This  mistake  is  easily
made, especially when copying a group of letters that are very similar.

• Old  Testament  example.  In  Jeremiah  51:3a  the  word  K7rod:yI  (yidro4k,  “he
drew  [a  bow]”)  appears  twice,  consecutively;  the  Masoretes,  recognizing
the mistake, left the second Krdy (ydrk) unvocalized. The Hebrew text of
Jeremiah 51:3a reads as follows in the MT:

wOt@#$

;qa K7r'd@

oha Krdy K7rod:yI-l)e “Let not the archer bend bend his bow.”3

• New  Testament  example.  Dittography  may  have  occurred  in  Mark  3:16
where the words e0poi/hsen tou_j dw&deka (“and he appointed the twelve”)
appears to be repeated from verse 14.

2.1.5 Metathesis

A reversal in the order of two letters or words. This is a common typographical
error; for example, “urn” for “run,” “dog” for “god,” or “nay” for “any.” 

• Old  Testament  example.  Deuteronomy  31:1  of  the  MT  reads  h#$

emo  K7ley@
'wA
(wayye4lek  mo4s\eh,  “And  Moses  went”),  but  a  manuscript  from  Qumran
(4QDtn) has h#$m lkyw (wykl ms\h, “And Moses ﬁnished”). The difference be-
tween  the  two  readings  is  that  the  letters  l  (la4med)  and  k  (kap)  have
switched positions.

• New  Testament  example.  In  John  1:42  the  name  0Iwa/nnou  (Io4annou,  “of
John”; â66, 75, ), etc.) is read as  0Iwna~ (Io4na, “of Jonah”) in some manuscripts
(A, B2, etc.) which suggests both metathesis and the removal of some letters.

2.1.6 Fusion 

Incorrect word division that results in two words being joined as one. An illus-
tration in English would be, “the man held his handout” (rather than hand out). 

• Old Testament example.  Fusion probably appears in the  MT of Leviticus
16:8, “And Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats, one for the LORD and the
other lot for Azazel (lz')zf(jla, la(a6za4)ze4l)” (see also vv. 10, 26). Medieval rab-
bis identiﬁed Azazel as a hairy desert demon,4 but why would Aaron give

3This verse is difﬁcult to translate. It reads this way in the Peshitta, Vulgate and Targum, but
other readings have been suggested (e.g., “Let not him who bends his bow bend it” [NASB]).
4For  a  good  discussion  of  this  view  see  Gordon  J.  Wenham,  The  Book  of  Leviticus,  NICOT
(Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1979), pp. 233-34.

one of the goats to a demon? It makes more sense to divide the name in two,
lz')o z('lf (la4(e4z )o4ze4l, “for the goat of departure [or ‘going away’],” referring
to the goat that is led off into the desert. This reading is supported by the
LXX and Vulgate.

• New Testament example. In Mark 10:40 a)ll' oi[j (“but for whom”; A, B2,
etc.) is read as a!lloij “for others” in some manuscripts (), B*, D, etc.).

2.1.7 Fission

One word that has incorrectly been separated into two. For example, “Jenni-
fer is a grand child” can be a mistake of ﬁssion that should read “Jennifer is a
grandchild.” 

f#$

• Old Testament example. Fission may appear in Hosea 6:5c where the MT
;miw% (u=mis\pa4t@eyka4 )o=r ye4s@e4), “and your judgments, light
reads )c'y' rwO) K1y+ep%
goes forth”), but the LXX reads kai: to: kri8ma mou w(j fw~j e)celeu8setai, “and
my judgment goes forth like light.” The latter suggests a Hebrew reading of
% (u=mis\pa4t@|< ke6)o=r ye4s@e4)), wherein the ka4p is joined to the fol-
)c'y" rwO)k; y+ip%
lowing word.5

;miw%

f#$

• New Testament example. A few manuscripts of Romans 7:14 split the word
oi1damen “we know” (B2, D2, etc.) into oi]da me\n, (“on the one hand I know”;
33, ≥ 833, etc.).

2.1.8 Homoioteleuton and Homoioarkton

Homoioteleuton is an omission caused by two words or phrases that end simi-
larly. Homoioarkton is an omission caused by two phrases that begin similarly.
Sometimes these are called parablepsis, meaning “oversight” or “faulty seeing.”
This can happen with numbers as well as words. For instance, in copying the
numbers 523, 432, 600, 446, 732, it would be easy for the eye to skip from 432 to
732 because of their like endings, leaving out the two numbers in between. 

• Old Testament example. In 1 Samuel 14:41, a portion is missing from the

MT that appears in other versions. The LXX reads:

And Saul said, “O Lord, God of Israel, why have you not answered your servant this
day? If the iniquity is in me or in my son Jonathan, O Lord, God of Israel, give Urim(?);
but if this iniquity is in thy people Israel, give Thummim(?).”

The words in italics do not appear in the MT, perhaps because the eyes of
the scribe jumped from the ﬁrst occurrence of the word Israel to the third, omit-
ting the words in between.

A   S T U D E N T ’ S   G U I D E   T O   T E X T U A L   C R I T I C I S M   O F   T H E   B I B L E

• New Testament example. In 1 John 2:23 the phrase to\n pate/ra e1xei (“has
the father”) (), B, C, etc.) appears twice, causing a copyist’s eyes to skip
from the ﬁrst to the second and omit the intervening words o( o(mologw~n to\n
ui(o/n kai\ (“the one who confesses the Son also”) (vgms, boms). 

2.1.9 Other Omissions or Additions 

Other changes occur, sometimes due to vowel pointings, sometimes possibly
because  abbreviations  were  misinterpreted6  and  sometimes  for  no  apparent
reason.

• Old Testament example.  In 1 Samuel 13:1 the number of years that Saul
reigned  in  Jerusalem  appears  to  be  left  out.  This  is  why  various  modern
translations differ in the translation at this verse:

NASB: “Saul was forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-

two years over Israel.”

NIV:

“Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Is-
rael forty-two years.”

KJV:

“Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel . . .”

The ﬁrst two translations acknowledge that the ages have fallen out and
supply the missing information using logical deduction. However, the King
James Bible just translates it as if nothing has fallen out of the text.

• New Testament example. Some of the better manuscripts (â46, )*, B*, etc.)

omit the phrase e0n  )Efe&sw| (“in Ephesus”) in Ephesians 1:1.

2.2 Intentional Changes

Evidence suggests that the Hebrew text was somewhat ﬂexible until the ﬁrst
century  A.D.  when  it  became  uniﬁed.  Following  the  ﬁrst  century  A.D.,  the
scribes’ primary desire was to retain this text. The scribes clearly had a great
reverence for the text; therefore it is reasonable to assume that any changes
were an attempt to improve or clarify the text, with no intention of corrupting
it. The Jewish nation believed the Scriptures were a living book with continu-
ing relevance, prompting scribes occasionally to update or expand the text to
make it more readily understandable. 

• Old  Testament  example.  In  Genesis  14:14  the  MT  says  that  Abraham
chased the kings who captured his nephew Lot as far as “Dan,” but ac-

6See Godfrey R. Driver, “Abbreviations in the Masoretic Text,” Textus 1 (1960): 112-31; and his,
“Once Again Abbreviations,” Textus 4 (1964): 76-94; cf. Michael Fishbane, “Abbreviations,
Hebrew Texts,” IDBSup, pp. 3-4.

51

cording to Joshua 19:47 and Judges 18:29 the city was not named Dan un-
til many years later. It is plausible that a later scribe realizing that the city
was now called Dan, changed the text in Genesis 14:14 to reﬂect this new
name.

• New  Testament  example.  It  appears  that  a0mh/n  (“amen”)  was  added  to
some manuscripts (), 436, 2464, K, L, P, etc.) in 1 Peter 5:14 possibly in order
to make it more similar to the ending of 2 Peter.

In  their  zealousness  to  preserve  Scrip-
ture,  scribes  had  a  tendency  to  include  ev-
erything  in  the  text  (e.g.,  glosses,  marginal
notes, insertions) rather than omit anything;
thereby expanding the text in some places.
The New Testament appears to have experi-
enced  less  ﬂexibility  in  the  transmissional
process, but it is still plausible that copyists
made modiﬁcation to certain texts. 

Since  the  transmission  of  Scripture  oc-
curred over such a long period of time and
under such diverse conditions, it is possible
that many intentional changes may never be
detected, or if detected, the original wording
may  never  be  determined.  Intentional
changes  are  much  more  controversial—not
everyone  agrees  on  speciﬁc  examples,  but
the following give an indication of the pur-
pose of intentional changes.

2.2.1 Changes in Spelling or Grammar

Over time, scribes apparently tended to update archaic language so that the
text could be better understood.

• Old  Testament  example.  The  MT  of  Psalm  11:1d  reads  rwOp%c  Mker:ha  wdIw%n
(nu=diw harkem s@ippo=r, “ﬂee to your mountain a bird”). But the  LXX (Psalm
10:2) reads metanasteu&ou e0pi\ ta\ o1rh w9j strouqi&on (“ﬂee to the mountain
like  a  bird”).  The  latter  appears  to  follow  an  original  Hebrew  reading  of
; rha ydIw@n  (nu=d|< har ke6mo= s@ippo=r), that includes the archaic Hebrew
rwOp%
@ci wOmk@
; (ke6mo=), meaning “like, as.” It is quite plausible that a scribe was
form wOmk@
confused by the archaic form.7

• New  Testament  example.  In  Matthew  1:7-8  the  name  Asaph  ()Asa/f)  is
found  in  several  older  manuscripts  (â1vid,  ),  B,  etc.),  but  later  copyists
apparently  believed  they  were  correcting  the  text  by  changing  it  to  Asa
()Asa/), the king of Judah (1 Kings 15:9-24) (L, W, D, etc.).

2.2.2 Clearing Up Other Difﬁculties

Since  the  biblical  text  was  intended  to  be  read  and  understood  by  people
through many millennia, it is reasonable that copyists may have modiﬁed un-
clear phrases, rare words or even words used in an unusual way so that they
could be more easily understood.

• Old Testament example. In Isaiah 39:1 the MT uses the word qzaxf (h[a4zaq)
with  the  unusual  meaning  “to  get  well,  recuperate,”  but  the  ﬁrst  Isaiah
Scroll  found  at  Qumran  (1QIsaa)  has  hyfxf  (h[a4ya=,  “to  live,  revive,  recuper-
ate”), which is the more common word.

• New Testament example. The composite quotation from Malachi 3:1 and
Isaiah 40:3 in Mark 1:2-3 is sometimes attributed to “Isaiah the prophet” in
earlier manuscripts (), B, etc.), but some later copyists modiﬁed it to e)n toi=j
profh&taij (“in the prophets”) (A, W, etc.).

2.2.3 Harmonization 

Harmonization is the modiﬁcation of one passage to make it agree with an-
other. This appears more commonly in the New Testament, especially in the
Gospels where there are several similar accounts of a story. 

• Old Testament example. The editors of the BHS3 suggest adding the phrase

which would make a similar structure to that found in verses 4, 10, 12, 18,
21, 31 and correspond to verse 8 in the LXX.

• New  Testament  example.  A  variant  of  the  phrase  in  John  19:20,  h]n
gegramme/non 9Ebrai"sti/,  9Rwmaisti//,  9Ellhnisti/ (“It was written in Hebrew,
in Latin, in Greek”), was added to Luke 23:38 in some manuscripts (C3, W,
D, etc.).

2.2.4 Euphemistic Changes

A euphemism is the substitution of a milder term for a more unpleasant or of-
fensive  one,  but  sometimes  changes  were  made  simply  to  smooth  out  the
grammar or help the text to sound better.

eboypim;
[me6p|<bo4s\et, “from before shame”]).8 A plausible explanation for this change
is that the Baal cult posed a signiﬁcant active threat to Yahwism when the
books of Samuel were written, so the author substituted a euphemism for
the offensive name Baal. By the Chronicler’s time, however, the Baal cult
had become less of a threat and he was able to employ the name.

• New  Testament  example.  Several  scribes  appear  to  have  had  difﬁculty
copying the phrase “your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will re-
ward you” (Matthew 6:4, 6) without adding the phrase e)n tw~
| (“in
the open” or “openly”; L, W, D, etc.); or the word grammate/wn (“scribes”)
without adding kai\ Farisai/wn (“and Pharisees”; Mt 27:41; D, W, etc.).

2.2.5 Theological Changes

Some changes apparently were made for theological reasons, either because
God (or someone else) was placed in an unfavorable light or the text seemed
irreverent. Modiﬁcations removed the offending words or phrase.

• Old Testament example. It seems that Genesis 18:22 originally read “and
God remained standing before Abraham.” However, the phrase “to stand
before someone” later came to denote subservience to that person. Scribes
therefore rearranged the sentence order out of reverence for God.

• New Testament example. In Luke 2:41, 43, the words oi ( gonei=j au)tou= (“his

parents”) have been changed to “Joseph and Mary” (v. 41) in some manu-
scripts (1012, It), or “Joseph and his mother” (A, C, Y, etc.), possibly to safe-
guard the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus.

2.2.6 Additions and Glosses

There are several apparent instances of additions, glosses (explanatory notes)
or  further  explanations  of  difﬁcult  words  and  phrases  in  the  biblical  text.
These notes may have been originally written into the text or were later incor-
porated from marginal notes. In the New Testament especially, these additions
are sometimes conﬂations, combining two or more readings. 

• Old  Testament  example.  In  Genesis  7:6b  a  phrase  appears  to  have  been
added  to  clarify  an  unusual  word  Cre)fhf  l(a  MyIma  hyfhf  lw%b@m@
ahaw:
(we6hammabbu=l  ha4ya=  mayim  (al  ha4)a4res[,  literally,  “and  the  ﬂood  was  water
upon the earth”). The unusual word lw%b@ma (mabbu=l, “ﬂood”) is clariﬁed by
the phrase Cre)fhf l(a MyIma (mayim (al ha4)a4res[, cf. 6:17).9

• New Testament example. Some manuscripts of Luke 24:53 add the word
a0mh/n (“amen”) at the end of the verse which suggests that some thought a
Gospel should end this way (see mss of Matthew 28:20; A2, D, Q, etc.).

Generally it is easier to spot an unintentional change—they are a more pre-
dictable result of the copying process. An intentional error, on the other hand,
is  much  more  difﬁcult  to  determine.  Bruce  Metzger  observes,  “scribes  who
thought were more dangerous than those who wished merely to be faithful in
copying what lay before them.”10
 Intentional errors are much harder to detect
and correct since it is generally difﬁcult to know why the changes were made.
Sometimes scribes even reintroduced a previously corrected error, as Metzger
points out:

In the margin of codex Vaticanus at Heb. i.3 there is a curiously indignant note
by a rather recent scribe [perhaps from the thirteenth century] who restored the
original reading of the codex, fanerw~n, for which a corrector had substituted the
usual reading, fe/rwn: “Fool and knave, can’t you leave the old reading alone and
not alter it!” (a)maqe/state kai _ kake/, a!fej to _n palaio/n, mh _ metapoi/ei).11 

Intentional  errors  were  likely  introduced  into  the  text  when  the  copyist
thought that a word was misspelled, contained a theological mistake or ap-
peared not to correspond to another biblical passage.

Transmission of the Biblical Texts

This chapter describes the transmission of the biblical texts, as far as their history
is known. After the Old and New Testament texts reached their ﬁnalized forms,
they  were  copied  and  maintained  throughout  their  history.  This  chapter  de-
scribes this process and lays the foundation for the rest of the book.

It is hard for us who commonly own multiple copies of the Bible to understand
that  for  much  of  the  Old  and  New  Testaments’  history  individuals  rarely
owned even a part of a Bible. In Old Testament times the sacred scrolls were
kept in the temple and generally were handled and read only by the priests
and  possibly  the  Levites.  By  New  Testament  times  the  entire  collection  of
books that made up the Bible would have been very expensive, and much of
the  New  Testament  circulated  as  individual  books  or  letters. A  low  literacy
rate was also a factor during much of the time of the transmission of Scrip-
tures.  Still  these  works  were  maintained  and  handed  down  through  many
generations. Understanding some of this history will provide a better founda-
tion for textual criticism. 

3.1 The Old Testament Text

If Moses, living in the ﬁfteenth century B.C., wrote or collected any of the Pen-
tateuch, then some Old Testament texts would have been transmitted for more
than  three  thousand  years  before  we  received  them  in  our  modern  transla-
tions. This naturally leads to such crucial questions as, Who copied these texts
through the millennia? What did they look like? How were they maintained?
Are the texts we have today an accurate reﬂection of the original texts? Each
of  these  questions  will  be  examined  in  this  chapter.  There  are  no  original
manuscripts (or autographa) of the Old Testament—any extant manuscript is a
copy of an earlier one. The word manuscript derives from a Latin word mean-
ing “that which is written by hand.” Until the invention of the printing press
in the ﬁfteenth century, all books were copied by hand.

Since there is so little evidence concerning this early period, we are left with
several signiﬁcant questions. First, in what language(s) were the earliest bibli-
cal  manuscripts  written?  Bruce  Waltke  and  Michael  O’Connor  believe  that
Moses wrote in some form of Hebrew, but they also point out that several lan-
guages of the period were fairly similar:

A variety of related languages and dialects, more or less closely related to He-
brew, were recorded at the time Hebrew scriptures were being written. The Iron
Age (1200-500 
.) forms a convenient watershed in the history of Syro-Palestin-
B
ian languages, though the signiﬁcance of the year 1200 should not be exagger-
ated: the earliest Biblical Hebrew had a great deal in common with Ugaritic and
Amarna Canaanite.

Some of these early Semitic alphabetic inscriptions go back to the early sec-
ond  millennium  (e.g.,  grafﬁti  from  the  turquoise  mining  area  of  Serbit  el-

the earliest extant texts are written in
this script.

The changeover from paleo-Hebrew
to  square  (or  Aramaic)  script  took
place between the ﬁfth and third cen-
turies B.C.4 and would probably have
been hastened by the Jewish exile in
Babylon,  where  Aramaic  was  the
common  language.5  Knowing  about
the  similarities  between  speciﬁc  let-
ters in both paleo-Hebrew and square script can help identify and date certain
copying mistakes. For example, the wa4w and the yo=d were very similar in the
Hebrew square script written at Qumran, but they are not as similar in paleo-
Hebrew script (see ﬁgure 3.3).

Second, did the Israelites originally use scripto continua (continuous writ-

dots between words (see ﬁg. 3.4).7 However, these are not biblical scrolls and
they  date  to  a  time  signiﬁcantly  later  than  when  the  earliest  biblical  manu-
scripts would have appeared. On the other hand, the earliest proto-Canaanite
or paleo-Hebrew inscriptions do not ordinarily evince word divisions. 

Figure 3.4. The paleo-Hebrew inscription at the end of Hezekiah’s Tunnel, discovered in
1880 by some schoolboys. Notice the dots between words.8 

The earliest extant portion of a biblical text appears without spaces and is
written  on  silver  amulets,  but  amulets  may  not  have  been  treated  with  the
same reverence as biblical manuscripts. Evidence indicates that at least from
the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls, biblical texts were written with spaces be-
tween the words to aid in the reading of the text, though some of these scrolls
have unclear word divisions. Sometimes an incorrect word division can cause
problems in the transmission of the Old Testament. For example in Amos 6:12
the Hebrew reads literally as: 

Do horses run on rocky crags? 
Does one plow with oxen? [MyrIqfb;
But you have turned justice into poison, 
and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness.

proximately the early sixth century, as follows: “The latter are of value for the textual critic
because of the incidence of scribal errors, the use of the scriptio defectiva rather than the fuller
forms of the Massoretic tradition, the presence of the dot as a word-divider, and the fact that
the language of the ostraca is to all intents and purposes the kind of classical Hebrew famil-
iar from the Old Testament writings” (Introduction to the Old Testament [Grand Rapids: Eerd-
mans, 1969], p. 246).

swer to the ﬁrst question is no (horses may fall if they run on rocky crags), but

is preferred in that the Hebrew word for “oxen” is a collective noun not requir-
ing the plural, and it anticipates a negative answer like its parallel unit.

Third, what material were the early manuscripts written on? It is likely that
the biblical texts were written on papyrus or leather scrolls.9 These materials
were extremely perishable in the semi-arid land of Palestine and thus required
constant copying by the priests or scribes. Jeremiah 36:2 gives some indication
as to the writing process when God tells Jeremiah to “Take for yourself a scroll
and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you.” Scrolls were limited
in length by their bulk and manageability, but they continued to be used in
synagogues even after the codex (a manuscript bound in book form) was in-
troduced for private use in the second century A.D.10

Our ﬁnal question, Who maintained these biblical texts in this early period?
does not have a deﬁnitive answer. It appears that initially the Old Testament
texts  were  copied  by  priests,  Levites  or  scribes,  who  reverenced  and  main-
tained them as records of Israel’s early history and their relationship to Yah-
weh. Waltke and O’Connor make an interesting point:

That no other Israelite writings, such as the Book of Yashar (e.g., 2 Sam 1:18) or
the Diaries of the Kings (e.g., 2 Chr 16:11), survive from this period indirectly sug-
gests the determination of the scribes to preserve the books that became canoni-
cal. The foes of Hebrew Scripture sometimes included audiences who sought to
kill its authors and destroy their works (cf. Jeremiah 36). From the time of their
composition, however, they capture the hearts, minds and loyalties of the faithful
in Israel who kept them safe often at risk to themselves. Such people must have
insisted on the accurate transmission of the text.11

Even from a very early period there is evidence that some books of Scrip-
ture  were  treated  with  reverence  and  were  thought  to  be  authoritative  (Ex
17:14-16; 24:3-4, 7). The stone tablets upon which the Lord inscribed the Ten
Commandments were stored in the ark of the Covenant (Ex 25:16, 21; Deut
10:2-5; 1 Kings 8:9; Heb 9:4), a sacred place. The law of Moses was to be taught

to the priests and commanded to be publicly read aloud every seven years so
that  the  Israelites  would  not  forget  God’s  laws  (Deut  31:9-11);  it  was  to  be
stored alongside the ark of the covenant (Deut 31:24-26); and nothing was to
be added to or deleted from its words (Deut 4:2; 12:32). The Old Testament

recorded by prophets (1 Chron 29:29; 2 Chron 9:29; 12:15; 13:22; 20:34; 26:22;

(MyrIpfs@
[Darius II] reign, I, Daniel, understood from the books, according to the word
of the LORD to Jeremiah the prophet, the number of years for the desolation
of Jerusalem would be seventy years.” This passage indicates that in Daniel’s
time the book of Jeremiah was part of a larger collection of books that he con-
sidered authoritative.12

3.1.2 The Old Testament Text 400 B.C. to A.D. 100 

Sometime toward the beginning of this period the Old Testament canon was
completed, as Roland K. Harrison explains:

In all its essentials the canon was most probably complete by about 300 B.C., and
while  discussion  concerning  certain  component  parts  was  continued  well  into
the Christian era, the substance of the canon as it existed a century and a half after
the time of Ezra and Nehemiah remained unaffected by these controversies.13

From about 500 B.C. to A.D. 100 an inﬂuential group of teachers and interpreters
of the Law called sopherim, “scribes,” arose to preserve Israel’s sacred traditions,
the foundation of the nation.14 The Babylonian Talmud (Qidd. 30a) says, “The an-
cients were called soferim because they counted [sfr] every letter in the Torah.” 

3.1.2.1 Preserving the text. Hebrew manuscripts copied before the ﬁrst cen-
tury A.D. show two tendencies on the part of the scribes: they preserved the
accuracy of the text, and at the same time were willing to revise or update
the text.15 One of the best examples of the preserving of the text is found in
the textual tradition from Qumran, which follows the proto-MT and contains
the majority of the manuscripts (35 percent according to Tov).16 These manu-

scripts are very similar to manuscripts of the MT from about A.D. 1000. Eman-
uel Tov states:

As a rule, the scribes treated Mà [MT] with reverence, and they did not alter its
orthography and morphology as did the scribes of the Ä [SP] . . . and of many
of the Qumran scrolls. . . . Since à contains a carefully transmitted text, which
is well-documented in a large number of copies, and since it is reﬂected in the
rabbinic literature as well as in the Targumim and many of the Jewish-Greek
revisions of Ö [LXX], it may be surmised that it originated in the spiritual and
authoritative  center  of  Judaism  (later  to  be  known  as  that  of  the  Pharisees),
possibly in the temple circles. It was probably the temple scribes who were en-
trusted with the copying and preserving of Mà. Though this assumption cannot
be  proven,  it  is  supported  by  the  fact  that  the  temple  employed  correctors
(Myhygm, maggihim) who scrutinized certain scrolls on its behalf. . . . The fact
that all the texts left by the Zealots at Masada (dating until 73 CE) reﬂect à is
also important.17

I agree with Tov that the MT originated with the spiritual and authoritative
center of Judaism, and by the end of this period there was a uniﬁed tradition
of this text that appears to have been accepted universally by Judaism. Even
the Christians, who often used the LXX in everyday life, understood that the
LXX was based on an authoritative Hebrew source (e.g., see Justin Martyr’s de-
bates with Typho).

3.1.2.2 Revising the text. At the same time the scribes were preserving the
text, they also revised it in at least three different ways: (1) sometime during
this period the change from paleo-Hebrew to Assyrian square script occurred
(see earlier discussion); (2) the orthography (i.e., spelling) and archaic forms of
the proto-MT were beginning to be updated; and (3) corrections were made (as
suggested in texts from the Dead Sea area, e.g., 4QIsaa). William F. Albright
states: “A principle which must never be lost sight of in dealing with docu-
ments of the ancient Near East is that instead of leaving obvious archaisms in
spelling and grammar, as later became the fashion in Greece and Rome, the
scribes  generally  revised  ancient  literary  and  other  documents  periodically.
This practice was followed with particular regularity by cuneiform scribes.”18
These tendencies are not contradictory—the scribes assigned to Scriptures a
high degree of authority and upheld them with great reverence, but their de-
sire was for readers to understand them. This care in copying corresponds well
with the copying practices throughout the ancient Near East as Albright also

points  out:  “The  prolonged  and  intimate  study  of  the  many  scores  of  thou-
sands of pertinent documents from the ancient Near East proves that sacred
and profane documents were copied with greater care than is true of scribal
copying in Graeco-Roman times.”19

The  Egyptian  pyramid  texts,  which  were  copied  meticulously  even
though  they  were  never  to  be  seen  by  human  eyes,  also  demonstrate  this
type of care in the copying process.20 Kenneth Kitchen quotes the boast of an
Egyptian scribe dating to about 1400 B.C.: “[The book] is completed from its
beginning  to  its  end,  having  been  copied,  revised,  compared  and  veriﬁed
sign  by  sign.”21  The  sacred  Scriptures,  which  the  Israelites  believed  came
from God through their forefathers and prophets, were maintained with sim-
ilar or greater care.

However, one type of revision that the scribes felt was necessary to accu-
rately preserve the text was the addition of matres lectionis (“mothers of read-
ing”),  which  did  not  affect  the  meaning  or  pronunciation  of  the  word  but
helped to clarify which form of the word the author intended. In the earliest
phase  of  its  development  Hebrew  was  written  only  with  consonants,  but
possibly as early as the ninth century B.C. the consonants h (he4), y (yo=d) and
w (wa4w) were added to some words to indicate three classes of long vowels
(see  earlier  discussion).22  These  long  vowels  sometimes  were  used  as  case
endings to signify the grammatical function of words, but they always aided
in the proper pronunciation of the text.23 As the language continued to de-
velop, scribes used the matres lectionis more extensively, which increased the
certainty as to how the text should be translated. David Freedman has dated
the form of the proto-MT, which was maintained in the MT, to between the
third and second century B.C., based on its orthography (primarily the num-
ber of matres lectionis);24 both the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Qumran ma-
terials use more matres lectionis. Once the proto-MT became uniﬁed in the ﬁrst
century A.D., further additions of matres lectionis were not permitted. During
the ﬁfth to ninth centuries, another system to facilitate proper pronunciation
was developed that used vowel points in the text. Several different pointing
systems appeared in various scribal schools, but in time the Tiberian point-

ing system gained general acceptance.25 

Evidence from about the mid-third century B.C. on suggests that there were
several centuries during which a variety of texts of the Old Testament existed
simultaneously (e.g., at least, proto-MT, LXX, SP and possibly other forms sug-
gested by the manuscripts found in the Dead Sea area).26 However, there has
been signiﬁcant discussion as to how the proto-MT arose as well as the variety
of other forms (see table 3.1). 

Paul de Lagarde (1827-1891) argued that all the Hebrew texts derive from
one original manuscript (a single copy [ein einziges Exemplar]; see ﬁg. 3.5).27 He
reasoned that since all Masoretic manuscripts have some speciﬁc characteris-
tics in common (e.g., the puncta extraordinaria, dots above letters considered
questionable by scribes), they must be dependent on one another, and there-
fore it is possible to retrieve the original text. By the time of Paul Kahle (1875-
1964), the number of known manuscripts had increased and several divergent
text types had been identiﬁed. Kahle argued that there were many vulgar texts
(Vulgärtexte, or corrupted texts) that were standardized into an ofﬁcial text (see
ﬁg. 3.5).28 In the mid-1950s two other scholars, William F. Albright and Frank
M. Cross, began to develop a third view, arguing for the possibility of local re-
censions/text  types/families.29  This  theory  reduced  the  textual  witnesses  to
three text types from different areas: Palestine (SP,  MT of Chronicles, several
Qumran texts), Babylon (MT) and Egypt (LXX; see ﬁgure 3.6).30 

25Even as late as Codex Reuchlinianus (A.D. 1105) another pointing system (not Tiberian) was
used. Scholars disagree as to whether it was pre-Masoretic (Alexander Sperber, Codex Reuchlin-
ianus with a General Introduction: Masoretic Hebrew, Corpus Hebraicorum Medii Aevi 2/1 [Copen-
hagen: Munksgaard, 1956], intro.), post-Masoretic (Shelomo Morag, “The Vocalization of Codex
Reuchlinianus: Is the ‘Pre-Masoretic’ Bible Pre-Masoretic?” JSS 4 [1959]: 229, 237), or a Tiberian
pointing system not accepted by the Masoretes (Moshe H. Goshen-Gottstein, “The Rise of the
Tiberian Bible Text,” in Biblical and Other Studies, ed. Alexander Altmann [Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press, 1963], pp. 113-14; Würthwein, Text of the Old Testament, pp. 21-28).

Paul de Lagarde 
(Göttingen)

1827-
1891

The MT started out as one original copy and all the manu-
scripts can be traced back to this original. Thus all the vari-
ous extant manuscripts are deviations or copies of a single 
original manuscript.

Paul Kahle
 (Oxford)

1875-
1964

There were many divergent manuscripts that were at some 
point standardized into an ofﬁcial text.

Albright
(1891-
1971)
Cross 
(1921-)

There may have been an original authoritative text, but it 
was copied and maintained in three different areas thus giv-
ing rise to three local recensions, text types or text families. 
These recensions originated from Palestine (SP, MT of Chron-
icles, some Qumran mss), Babylon (MT) and Egypt (LXX).

(1938-)

The Hebrew text had a diversity of forms, and the three text 
types are only a remnant of a much greater diversity in early 
Judaism that was subsequently lost. The three recensions 
were retained because they were protected by religiously 
cohesive social groups: the LXX by the Christians, the SP by 
the Samaritans and the MT by rabbinic Judaism.a 

There was not one original authoritative text, but there may 
have been several authoritative forms of a biblical book. He 
questions the recensions, or text families, and argues instead 
that the various manuscripts are related to each other “in an 
intricate web of agreements, differences, and exclusive read-
ings.”b He recognizes ﬁve different groups among the Qum-
ran manuscripts: (1) mss following “Qumran practice” (20 
percent); (2) proto-Masoretic mss (60 percent); (3) pre-
Samaritan mss (5 percent); (4) Ur-LXX mss (5 percent); and 
(5) nonaligned mss (15 percent [sic 105%]).

Similar to Talmon, emphasizing a great diversity of biblical 
texts by late Second Temple times, but these arose from a 
succession of “literary editions” of books (or parts of books) 
as temporary stages in evolution toward the ﬁnal canonical 
form. Each new literary edition was produced by a creative 
editor responding to a new religious situation, and thus the 
distinction between literary development of the text and tex-
tual transmission is blurred.c

Cross  went  on  to  argue  that  the  SP  became  a  divergent  sectarian  recension
around 100 B.C., whereas the proto-MT went on to become the standard text of the
rabbis around A.D. 100. While the idea of local textual traditions is helpful in ex-
plaining the diversity among the related manuscripts, the Qumran scrolls seem
to indicate greater similarities between some of these so-called text types than the
concept suggests. But it is likely that there was signiﬁcant interaction between
these geographical areas so that similarities may be accounted for by similar Vor-
lagen or the revisions that certain texts underwent. This type of correction and in-
teraction can be observed in the Isaiah Scroll from Qumran where corrections are
made right in the text. Still, the Albright and Cross model has been challenged by
several scholars;31 most recently Emanuel Tov has questioned both the notion of
an Ur-text that gave rise to the divergent text types as well as the grouping of
Qumran  texts  into  ﬁxed  text  types.  He  has  argued  instead  that  the  Qumran
manuscripts are related to one another in an intricate web of agreements, differ-
ences and exclusive readings.32 Tov believes that the Qumran manuscripts reveal
ﬁve different groups (four of which were unknown prior to the Qumran discov-
eries) distinguished on the basis of the content of their variants.33 

Tov’s arguments have not ruled out the possibility of an original text that

was copied and maintained in different areas, and in time began to look sig-
niﬁcantly different. But even this would also demand a certain amount of in-
teraction and inﬂuences between geographical areas, which corresponds with
what we know about trade and interaction among the different geographical
areas in the ancient Near East. In fact, it is possible that when the manuscripts
were brought to Qumran in the second century B.C., one of the things the Qum-
ran scribes began to do was to compare and correct them (as can be seen in
1QIsa). There is still much we do not know about the interaction that took place
in the development of the Hebrew texts, but the possibility of an autograph
seems to be implied in several Old Testament passages (Ex 17:14-16; 24:3-4, 7;
25:16, 21; Deut 31:9-11, 24-26; Josh 8:35, etc.). Also Adam S. van der Woude ar-
gues for a uniform tradition:

There was always a relative uniformity of textual tradition in the religious circles
around the temple in Jerusalem. This means that there was a basically uniform
tradition besides a pluriform tradition in Palestine Judaism in the last centuries
B.C., in the sense that only the proto-Masoretic textual tradition was passed on in
Jerusalem,  whereas  elsewhere  also  biblical  manuscripts  circulated  which  bore
close resemblance to the text of the Septuagint or the Samaritan Pentateuch or
differed in other respects from the proto-Masoretic tradition.34

Al Wolters states: “If these scholars are right, the MT represents a textual tra-
dition that can lay claim to a much higher degree of legitimacy than the other
ancient witnesses to the Hebrew Bible.”35

While certain texts appear to have been favored in certain geographical lo-
cations,  this  does  not  demand  that  text  types  developed  in  those  locations.
However, constant copying will cause these texts to have similarities. Because
of  the  movement  of  manuscripts  and  the  importance  of  these  works  to  the
Jews, it is reasonable to assume that scribes were constantly comparing texts
and attempting to improve their readings. But this occurred only within cer-
tain parameters since each of the text groups have what appear to be preferred
readings that were not accepted into the other manuscripts.

Until  about  sixty  years  ago  very  little  was  known  about  the  Hebrew  text
prior to A.D. 800—the only extant works that could shed light were the SP, the
LXX and the Nash Papyrus. Since then the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has
provided a great number of manuscripts dated between 250 B.C. and A.D. 50.

3.1.3 The Old Testament Text from About A.D. 100 to 500 

There is a signiﬁcant difference between the varied textual traditions found
at Qumran dating between the third and ﬁrst centuries B.C., and the minimal
deviations in the Hebrew texts from Masada (just prior to A.D. 73), the caves
at Nah[al H9ever (late ﬁrst century A.D.), and Wadi Murabba(at (written before
the Bar Kochba Revolt in A.D. 132-135). It is uncertain as to how this uniﬁed
text came about, but the traditional view has been that during the ﬁrst cen-
tury A.D. a strong movement emerged in Judaism to establish a uniﬁed, au-
thoritative text of the Hebrew Bible. This text was dependent on earlier tra-
ditions that were available to the Jewish scribes at that time, but variants and
differences in the text were removed. Once the scribes had a uniﬁed, author-
itative text, they were meticulous to ensure that the Hebrew text did not be-
come corrupted. Scholars have used the following arguments to substantiate
this view:36

All the extant Hebrew texts indicate a text very similar to the proto-MT with few

variations (Nash Papyrus, Masada mss, Nah[al H9ever mss, and Wadi Murabba(at
mss).

There  are  a  few  passages  from  rabbinic  literature  that  suggest  the  rabbis
had various forms of the Hebrew text which they weighed to establish a stan-
dardized text:

Three Codices [of the Pentateuch] were in the Court of the Temple, Codex Meon,
Codex Zaatute and Codex Hi. In one the reading was Nw(m refuge [Deut. XXXIII
27], and in the other two Codices read hnw(m [with the ﬁnal He], the reading of
the two was accepted and that of the one Codex was rejected. One Codex read
y+w+(z [= zhthth/v] enquires of [Exod. XXIV 5] and the other two Codices read
yr(n young men of, the reading of the two Codices was accepted and that of the
one Codex was rejected. In one Codex the reading )yh [with a Yod] occurred nine
times and in the other two Codices it occurred eleven times, the reading of the
two Codices was accepted and that of the one Codex was rejected.37

Several passages from rabbinic literature suggest that certain scribes were
paid from the temple funds to correct manuscripts (TB Keth. 106a; TJ Sheq. IV.3)
and that temple scrolls were used to check manuscripts (TJ Sanh. II.6). 

There was a desire to provide a consistent standard for debates between
Christians and Jews in the ﬁrst century  A.D. (see Justin Martyr Dialogue 68).
Hillel the Elder needed a standardized text on which to base his seven rules of
biblical hermeneutics (Rabbi Nathan 37A). Even though Josephus (c. A.D. 37-
100) in the late ﬁrst century A.D. is surely exaggerating, there may be a kernel
of truth in his statements:

But that our forefathers took no less, not to say even greater, care that the nations
I have mentioned in the keeping of their records—a task which they assumed to
their chief priests and prophets—and that down to our own time these records
have been, and if I may venture to say so, will continue to be, preserved with
scrupulous accuracy. (Josephus Contra Apion 1.29)38

Later Josephus states: 

We have given practical proof of our reverence for our own Scriptures. For, al-
though such long ages have now passed, no one has ventured either to add, or

remove, or to alter a syllable; and it is instinct with every Jew, from the day of his
birth to regard them as the decrees of God, to abide by them, and, if need be,
cheerfully to die for them. (Josephus Contra Apion 1.37-42)39

Albrektson, however, argues convincingly against this view. First, he sug-
gests that the reason the manuscripts from Murabba(at all belonged to the same
text type may be because they were associated with “the followers of the rebel
leader Bar Kochba, who was closely connected with the master of “normative”
Judaism, R. Aqiba.40 Second, the MT has numerous inconsistencies and copyist
errors, such as haplography, dittography and erroneous word divisions, that
should not appear if, in fact, there had been a careful comparison of manu-
scripts and textual traditions.41 He attributes this unity of the text in the ﬁrst
century A.D. to political and socioreligious factors of the time. Albrektson ar-
gues that the Pharisees, the only group to survive the destruction of the second
temple, maintained the proto-MT.42 He raises good questions concerning the
commonly held view of a purposeful standardization of the Hebrew text in the
ﬁrst century A.D. He has not, however, substantially supported a plausible al-
ternative view. Moshe Greenberg argued that the standardization of the He-
brew text took place much earlier in the second century B.C. by scribes within
reach  of  Jerusalem  who  were  able  to  critically  evaluate  the  various  manu-
scripts and textual variants and thus were able to exclude the proto-SP and the
Hebrew Vorlage of the LXX.43 Adam S. van der Woude agrees and states: 

Albrektson  is  right  in  assuming  that  the  textual  tradition  of  the  Hebrew  Bible
which won the day was used by the Pharisees. But this still leaves at least one
question unanswered. If, as he supposes, the textual tradition supported by the
Pharisees prevailed after 70 AD, it must have existed before that. But in view of
the pluriformity of the textual traditions of the Old Testament which can still be
observed in Qumran, we still have to explain how and why the Pharisees had an
essentially uniform textual tradition before the catastrophe of 70 AD.

We can infer that the standardization of the proto-Masoretic text of the Hebrew
Bible had basically already taken place in certain Jewish circles before 70 AD not
only from the discoveries of the biblical writings at Masada, but also from the fact
that “normative” Judaism had rejected the textual tradition of the Septuagint at
an early stage.44

Van der Woude argues that a uniﬁed textual tradition goes back at least as

far as the second century B.C. He then goes further and proposes an additional
theory be considered: there may have always been a relatively uniform text in
the religious circles of Jerusalem.45 He explains its development as follows:

The standardization of the proto-Masoretic tradition should be thought of as a
process,  in  which  readings  regarded  as  erroneous  were  gradually  expurgated,
sporadic changes were made in the text for theological reasons, and manuscripts
which did not meet the requirement of the standardized text were removed in the
course of time. . . . The event of 70 AD at most precipitated the ﬁnal phase in the
proto-Masoretic  textual  tradition,  but  did  not  bring  about  the  process  of  stan-
dardization as such.46

It  still  seems  somewhat  unclear  whether  the  text  was  intentionally  stan-
dardized,  gradually  expurgated  or  only  one  of  the  textual  traditions  main-
tained. Whatever the case, it is plausible that some variant readings may have
been lost or virtually eliminated in the process. From at least the ﬁrst century
A.D. onward the proto-MT was generally copied by well-trained, professional
scribes who were meticulous in their work. Jewish writings mention that the
temple  employed  correctors  (meggihim)  who  scrutinized  the  scrolls  to  safe-
guard their precision.47 

From about A.D. 100 to 300 a second group of scribes arose, called the Tan-
naim (ta4nna4|<m), or “repeaters” (i.e., teachers), who began copying their tradi-
tions shortly after the beginning of the Christian era. Sometime during the tal-
mudic  period  (100  B.C.  to  A.D.  400),  which  overlaps  the  periods  of  the
Sopherim, Tannaim and Amoraim, meticulous rules were developed to pre-
serve the Old Testament text in synagogue scrolls:

1. Only parchments made from clean animals were allowed; these were to be

joined together with thread from clean animals.

2. Each written column of the scroll was to have no fewer than forty-eight and

no more than sixty lines whose breadth must consist of thirty letters.

3. The page was ﬁrst to be lined, from which the letters were to be suspended.

4. The ink was to be black, prepared according to a speciﬁc recipe.

5. No word or letter was to be written from memory.

6. There was to be the space of a hair between each consonant and the space

45Ibid., p. 163. He says that Tov comes close to this position when he says: “Although . . . tex-
tual plurality was characteristic for all of Palestine, it appears that in temple circles there
existed a preference for one textual tradition, i.e., the texts of the Masoretic family” (see Tov,
Textual Criticism, p. 191).

funds”; cf. b. Pesah. 112a (Tov, Textual Criticism, pp. 28, 32, 190).

of a small consonant between each word, as well as several other spacing
rules.

7. The scribe must wash himself entirely and be in full Jewish dress before be-

ginning to copy the scroll.

8. He could not write the name Yahweh with a newly dipped brush, nor take

notice of anyone, even a king, while writing this sacred name.48

Later an entire tractate was devoted to the proper procedure for preparing a
sacred scroll and included even more rules intended to assure an accurate text.49
A third group of scribes who preserved the Hebrew texts from about A.D.
200 to 500 were called the Amoraim (amo=ra4|<m), or “expositors.” During this pe-
riod, the Talmud (from dmalf, la4mad, “to study”) began to be formed, containing
further expositions on the stipulations included in the Mishnah and the Ge-
mara (a commentary on the Mishnah). The Amoraim were centered in two ar-
eas, Babylonia and Palestine, giving rise to two Talmuds, the Babylonian and
the Palestinian. Some form of verse divisions for the Hebrew text are known
from this early period (even though Babylonian and Palestinian traditions dif-
fer),50  as well as paragraph and liturgical divisions. Rabbinic tradition indi-
cates that by this time scribes realized that the text was in need of some minor
corrections,  many  of  which  are  noted  in  Biblia  Hebraica  Stuttgartensia  (after-
ward BHS), either in the Masorah or in the text.

3.1.4 The Old Testament Text from About A.D. 500 to 1000

Around the end of the ﬁfth century A.D., a fourth group of scribes called the
Masoretes inherited the scribal traditions and carried on the work of preserv-
ing the text. Their diligent labors from about A.D. 500 to 1000 helped to pre-
serve the Hebrew text that we have today, the Masoretic Text. These scribes
were extremely careful and treated the text with great reverence. Their metic-
ulous notes regarding the text of the Old Testament helped maintain a remark-
ably accurate text for about a thousand years.

3.1.4.1 Masoretic notations. Though these scribes appear to have inherited a
uniﬁed text, they also had questions regarding the reading of some passages.
As we noted above, scribes of this period had both tendencies to preserve the
text as well as to revise the text; once the text was uniﬁed, however, the ability
to revise it was greatly hampered. Thus they developed special notations to in-

dicate questions concerning the text without changing the consonantal text.
Exactly when these notations were added is still unknown.

• Kethib and Qere readings.51 A frequent notation in the MT (848 to 1,566 times,
depending on the manuscript) denotes scribal questions concerning a spe-
ciﬁc word in the MT. Rather than change the consonantal text (i.e., the ke6t|<b,
“what  was  written”),  they  indicated  the  preferred  reading  (i.e.,  the  qe6re=,
“what  is  to  be  read”)  in  the  margin  (marked  with  a  q  underneath)  and
marked on the word in the text the vowel pointing of the qe6re=. 

• Special points (puncta extraordinaria). Fifteen times in the MT small diamonds
appear over letters or words to indicate reservations (either textual or doc-
trinal)  about  the  reading.  A  good  example  is  found  on  the  words  “and
Aaron” (

 we6)aha6ro4n) in Numbers 3:39.

 “All the numbered men of the Levites whom Moses and Aaron numbered accord-
ing to the mouth of the LORD by their families, every male from a month old and
upwards, (were) 22,000.” (literal translation)

The  scribes  apparently  questioned  the  originality  of  the  phrase  “and
Aaron,” since both verses 16 and 42 state that Moses (no mention of Aaron)
numbered the people.

• Suspended letters (litterae suspensae).52 Four times in the MT, letters are sus-
pended above the line (n [n] in Judges 18:30 and ( [( ] in Job 38:13, 15 and
Ps 80:14 [ET 80:13]) and all MT manuscripts agree in marking them. A good
example is the nu=n in Judges 18:30:

“The sons of Dan set up for themselves the graven image and Jonathan the son
of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests for the tribe of the

probably scribal signs that indicate the scribes thought the verses to be out
of order.

that indicate important details; for example, the ﬁrst letter of a book (Gen

• Sebirin.55 There are numerous sebirin found in various manuscripts (70 to

word  rbas;,  “to  suppose”)  in  the  marginal  notes.  Tov  states:  “The  Ma-
soretic terminology is therefore: Ny(+mw  Nyrybs, ‘it has been suggested
wrongly.’”56 Sebirin indicate words or forms of words that appear difﬁ-
cult  in  the  context  that  are  nevertheless  correct  and  should  not  be

tions”).57 There are at least eighteen of these corrections in the MT that re-
move  words  the  scribes  considered  objectionable  or  inappropriate.  A
good  example  is  in  Genesis  18:22;  because  the  phrase  “to  stand  before
someone” came to mean “to stand in subservience to someone,” the state-
ment “but the LORD remained standing before Abraham” was seen as dis-
respectful to God. The scribes, therefore, changed the order to “but Abra-
ham remained standing before the LORD” and noted in the margin that
here a correction had been made by the scribes (see also Num 11:15; 12:12;
1 Sam 3:13).

• Scribal omissions (itture sopherim, Myrps yrw+(, “scribal omissions”).58 The
Babylonian Talmud (Ned. 37b) mentions ﬁve places where a wa4w had been
left off a word (four times off the word dx), Gen 18:5; 24:55; Num 31:2; Ps
68:26 and once off of Ky+p#m, Ps 36:7).

These notations indicate how important it was to the scribes to retain a uni-
ﬁed text, while still being able to question certain readings that may have been
corrupted in the process of hand-copying. 

3.1.4.2 Masoretic families. There were two major venues of Jewish scholar-
ship during this period, one in Babylon and one in Palestine. Following the Is-
lamic conquest of Palestine in  A.D. 638, Tiberias once again revived and be-
came the chief center for Jewish textual studies.59 From about A.D. 500 to 800
the  Masoretes  added  vowel  points,  accents  and  the  Masorahs  (to  help  safe-
guard the text from error) as well as many scribal corrections.

In the early half of the tenth century two notable Masoretic families ﬂour-
ished  in  Tiberias,  the  Ben  Asher  and  Ben  Naphtali  families.  It  was  once
thought that these two families maintained signiﬁcantly different textual tra-
ditions, but more likely they represent only one textual tradition with minor
variations.60 There are only eight minor differences between the consonantal
texts of these two families, though they also differ as to word division and vo-

calization.61 Eventually, the Ben Naphtali tradition died out and the Ben Asher
tradition was maintained as the superior text.

3.1.5 The Hebrew Text After A.D. 1000 

The Masoretes hand copied the Hebrew text for over one thousand years be-
fore the invention of the printing press, and yet it has remained extremely ac-
curate. Every copy of the Hebrew Scriptures was a monumental task, and the
Masoretes  prided  themselves  on  retaining  the  accuracy  of  the  Hebrew  text.
One of the Masoretic schools in Alcalá, Spain, was so well known for produc-
ing accurate manuscripts that for almost a century after the printing press was
introduced the hand-printed manuscripts from this school still vied with those
produced by the printing press. Some of these manuscripts from this period
are still valuable for textual criticism and are described later in this book. There
are also about three thousand Hebrew manuscripts of the Tiberian tradition,
which date from the twelfth century A.D. on.62 In 1488 the ﬁrst complete He-
brew  Bible  was  printed  and  in  1516-1517  the  ﬁrst  Rabbinic  Bible  appeared.
Later, in 1524-1525, the Second Rabbinic edition was published; it was edited
by a Hebrew Christian named Jacob ben H9ayyim. This text included the rab-
binic notes for the Hebrew text which are the main reason the text retained
such accuracy over centuries of copying.

The proto-Masoretic and later Masoretic tradition has a long history, and

has enjoyed a privileged status, as Wolters points out: 

Our survey of late-twentieth-century scholarship on the ancient versions and the
Samaritan Pentateuch has revealed a paradoxical situation with respect to the MT
and its antecedents. On the one hand its status is that of only one of a number of
textual traditions, and on the other it seems to have had a privileged position.
Not only does it appear to preserve an older stage of the text than the Samaritan
Pentateuch, but it seems to have been regarded, from the ﬁrst century  B.C. on-
ward, as a standard against which the LXX should be corrected, and as the appro-
priate point of departure for new translations, notably the Targums, the Peshitta,
and the Vulgate. There is certainly no dispute that after about A.D. 100 the proto-
Masoretic text is regarded in Jewish circles as uniquely authoritative.63

3.2 The New Testament Text

In some senses the history of the transmission of the New Testament manu-
scripts is signiﬁcantly different than the Old Testament, since it was inﬂuenced
by the history of the early Christian church. The early church was persecuted

for much of its history and thus the transmission of the New Testament texts
often lacked much of the care and precision that the Old Testament received.
Still the early church held the New Testament texts with the same reverence
and authority as the Old Testament (cf. 2 Pet 3:15-16). An examination of the
history of the transmission of the New Testament will provide a foundation for
our study in New Testament textual criticism.

3.2.1 The New Testament Text Prior to A.D. 100

While there are no autographs of the New Testament, several papyrus frag-
ments date to the second century (â32, â46, â52, â64[+67], â66). â52 is a fragment
of the Gospel of John dated to the early second century, possibly only about
ﬁfty to seventy-ﬁve years after the book was written. The earliest New Testa-
ment manuscripts were written in an uncial script, somewhat similar to our
capital letters, on papyrus (see 2 Jn 12), but by the third century, parchment or
vellum  was  beginning  to  take  over  as  the  preferred  medium  of  writing  be-
cause it provided a better contrast to ink (see 2 Tim 4:13). Some of the shorter
New Testament books could have been written on a single piece of papyrus
(e.g., 2 and 3 Jn, Jude), but longer works would have been in the form of scrolls
(e.g., Matthew, Mark). 

Some New Testament material, such as the Gospel traditions, would ini-
tially have been circulated orally, whereas Paul’s letters would have been writ-
ten and sent to their recipients. The autographs were either written by their au-
thors or dictated to scribes (or amanuenses; see Rom 16:22; 2 Thess 3:17). Once
the letters were written, they were delivered to their respective churches by
friends or travelers going to that destination. For example, Tychicus, one of
Paul’s  friends  and  faithful  brother,  delivered  Paul’s  letters  to  the  Ephesians
(Eph 6:21-22), to the Colossians (Col 4:7-9) and possibly to Titus (Tit 3:12).

Paul  sometimes  encourages  the  recipients  of  his  letters  to  circulate  them
among the other churches (Col 4:16), and thus the autographs would at times
have been copied almost immediately and sent off to other churches. It is un-
likely that a professional scribe would be hired to copy these letters since the
cost  generally  would  have  been  prohibitive.  Most  likely  someone  from  the
various recipient churches would copy the autographs and send them on to
the next church. Bruce Metzger explains: “In the early years of the Christian
Church, marked by rapid expansion and consequent increased demand by in-
dividuals  and  by  the  congregations  for  copies  of  the  Scriptures,  the  speedy
multiplication  of  copies,  even  by  non-professional  scribes,  sometimes  took
precedence over strict accuracy of detail.”64 This may explain the large number

of New Testament manuscripts, and why there are generally more mistakes in
New Testament manuscripts than in copies of the Old Testament. Most if not
all of the New Testament books were completed by A.D. 100, after which began
the copying process. 

3.2.2 The New Testament Text After A.D. 100

During the beginning of the second century A.D., the Christians introduced a
new form of written text called the codex, which is very similar in form to our
modern books, being bound on the left side of the page.65 â52 is written on both
sides, suggesting that it was part of a codex rather than a scroll. To date, there
are only about ﬁve known New Testament manuscripts or fragments written
on papyrus dated to the second century, but since the early church was often
persecuted it is surprising that any of the manuscripts have survived. In A.D.
64 Nero charged the Christians with setting Rome on ﬁre and persecuted them
as traitors. In 303 Diocletian ordered all sacred Scriptures of the Christians to
be  burned,  but  soon  Emperor  Constantine  halted  their  persecution  and  de-
clared freedom of religion throughout the Roman Empire in the Edict of Milan
(313). The Christian church grew so fast during this period that Constantine re-
quested ﬁfty new copies of the Scriptures from Eusebius for the churches of
Constantinople. From the fourth century on it was the task of monks to study
and make copies of Scripture.

The manuscripts went through several different styles of writing following
A.D.  100,  including  uncial,  cursive  and  minuscule.  Uncial  script  was  com-
monly used between the ﬁrst and about the sixth century A.D., though it did
continue into the tenth or eleventh centuries. For several centuries these uncial
texts were written with no breaks between words. This could lead to mistakes
(e.g., see Mark 10:40 where the letters ALLOISHTOIMASTAI can be read as a)ll'
oi[j h9toi/mastai, “but [it is for] those whom it has been prepared,” or less likely
a@lloij h9toi/mastai, “but [it is for] others whom it has been prepared”). Codex
Sinaiticus  (fourth  century)  and  Codex  Alexandrinus  (ﬁfth  century)  do  not
have divisions between words, but by the sixth century, and possibly because
of the use of cursive writing, divisions began to appear between words. 

Only about one hundred of the early uncial manuscripts written on papyrus
have survived, but more written on parchment (c. 266) date from the fourth to
the tenth centuries. Cursive script, which can be likened to modern English cur-
sive writing, was used from about the third to ninth centuries. Cursive could be
written much more quickly since the letters are connected and often simpliﬁed,
as noted by Metzger: “For daily use this way of writing [uncial script] took too

much time, and at an early date cursive writing developed from the uncial and
continued to be used concurrently with it. Besides being more convenient, cur-
sive letters were often simpliﬁed as well as combined when the scribe would
join two or more together without lifting his pen (ligature).”66 The third type of
writing, minuscule script, is similar to cursive script only smaller; it eventually
predominated from the ninth century to about the ﬁfteenth century, when the
printing press was invented. This easy-to-write smaller script saved valuable
space on the parchment, which probably had become much more expensive. At
present there are about 2,754 New Testament minuscule manuscripts. 

At some early point the New Testament scribes also developed a system of
abbreviations for common words to save space. This goes back at least as far
as about A.D. 200 (â46 from the Chester Beatty collection) but apparently con-
tinued on into the minuscule manuscripts also. The following table shows ﬁf-
teen of the most commonly abbreviated words:

Generally the abbreviations include the ﬁrst and the last letter of the word;
the latter is necessary to indicate the declension, or part of speech, of the word.
The use of cursive script allowed for more possible mistakes to be made in the
copying process since it is harder to distinguish the letters, and the use of ab-
breviations led to word mix-ups. Few if any punctuation marks were added to
the earliest manuscripts (e.g., â46 and â66, both dated to about A.D. 200, include
occasional  punctuation  marks);  but  more  were  added  by  scribes  during  the
sixth and seventh centuries. Verse divisions were a very late development; in
fact, the ﬁrst English Bible to contain verse divisions was the Geneva Bible,
translated by William Whittingham in 1560. 

Parchment  and  leather  were  sometimes  cleaned  and  rescraped  for  reuse,
which  resulted  in  a  manuscript  called  a  “palimpsest,”  from  the  two  Greek
words pa/lin (palin, “again”) and ya/w (psao4, “to scrape”). About 20 percent of
extant New Testament manuscripts are palimpsests (e.g., Codex Ephraemi is a
ﬁfth-century  New  Testament  manuscript  that  was  erased  and  reused  in  the
twelfth century for thirty-eight sermons or treatises of Ephraem, a fourth-cen-
tury Syrian church father). 

In time the church developed a lectionary system for the Old and New
Testaments that enabled the entire Bible to be read in the course of several
years. At ﬁrst, notations were made in later uncial manuscripts that indi-
cated the order in which texts were to be read, beginning with Easter and
continuing throughout the year. Later, presumably for the convenience of
readers who most likely did not own their own Bible, lectionaries included
the text of the biblical passages to be read during worship services. The ear-
liest  extant  lectionaries  come  from  about  the  tenth  century  and  have  be-
come  another  source  for  determining  the  most  accurate  readings  of  the
New Testament.

3.2.3 The Transmission Process

The transmission process is certainly more complicated than is often thought:
New  Testament  manuscripts  were  likely  taken  from  one  place  to  another;
some were destroyed in wars; others were hidden; some may have been “cor-
rected” by copyists who compared them to other manuscripts; and they were
copied over a long period of time. Gordon Fee describes the earliest period of
textual transmission as follows: 

Much of the difﬁculty stems from the work of the earliest Christian copyists. In a
time when the majority of people were illiterate and when Christianity periodi-
cally  underwent  severe  persecution,  there  were  probably  few  professionally
trained scribes in the service of the church. Moreover, seldom were the scribes
possessed by the spirit of the scribes of the later times who worked according to

2005 Students Guide.book  Page 83  Thursday, June 17, 2010  3:07 PM

Transmission of the Biblical Texts

83

the instructions of the Lord given in Deuteronomy 12:32: “Thou shalt not add
thereto, nor diminish therefrom.” In fact, the opposite seems to have been true of
the scribes in the ﬁrst two centuries.67

As  scribes  inadvertently  and  sometimes  intentionally  introduced  errors
into their copies, a ripple effect would result: copies of their copies would pass
on these errors as well as new ones. Unless these manuscripts were compared
with others and “corrected,” mistakes would be retained. In principle, manu-
scripts can be compared and arranged into textual clusters based on similarity
of mistakes. While not all scholars agree with this general description of the
transmission  process,  Michael  Holmes  encapsulates  the  following  founda-
tional principles that are generally accepted:68

1.  Every  manuscript’s  textual  tradition  or  text-form  contains  evidence  of

corruption.

The various manuscripts demonstrate a progression from a rather undis-
ciplined or less accurate copying process from the latter ﬁrst and early sec-
ond centuries, to more disciplined and stable textual traditions in the ﬁfth
century. There is little evidence to suggest intentional “recensional” activity
(i.e., a scribe intentionally alters the text to make it correspond more closely
to his or her own views), but most variants in manuscripts appear to be the
result  of  unintentional  mistakes  or  scribes  who  intentionally  attempted  to
“correct” a text.

2. It is reasonable to assume that a greater quantity of later manuscripts will
be discovered than earlier ones due to the perishability of writing materials,
the number of manuscripts made and the possibility of their destruction (e.g.,
Tischendorf found monks burning old manuscripts to keep themselves warm
during one of his visits to St. Catherine’s monastery). Thus the transmission
process has been shaped by external circumstances, such as wars, persecution,
the rise of Islam and the politics of the Byzantine Empire.

3. Some late manuscripts may be copies of much earlier manuscripts (i.e., a
later copyist may have had access to an early manuscript). It appears possible
to reconstruct at least some stages of the transmission process (e.g., family 1
and family 13 demonstrate signiﬁcant textual similarities); this helps us to un-
derstand the broader picture of the transmission of the text. 

Sometimes  cross-contamination  was  the  result  of  seemingly  random

events, as Michael Holmes explains:

ments (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1993), p. 9.

Criticism, ed. David A. Black (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2002), pp. 92-97.

A   S T U D E N T ’ S   G U I D E   T O   T E X T U A L   C R I T I C I S M   O F   T H E   B I B L E

For example, an inﬂuential church leader (such as John Chrysostom) supplies,
or someone in a centrally located and/or better-supplied scriptorium (in Con-
stantinople,  for  example)  chooses—perhaps  for  reasons  having  nothing  to  do
with textual character; such as greater legibility, layout, format, or arrangement
of text, or simply because it was close at hand—a manuscript as an exemplar
from which to make new copies and a standard against which to correct existing
ones; and as a result the Bibles in use in the area(s) inﬂuenced by that leader or
scriptorium begin to reﬂect the textual character (whatever it happens to be) of
the selected model.69

The transmission process then was not always consistent, nor did it neces-

sarily follow well-deﬁned principles. 

In some senses the history of the New Testament is similar to that of the Old
Testament in that during the second century there may have been competing
forms of the New Testament (e.g., Marcion had a reduced canon from the or-
thodox church). More recently, Bart Ehrman has suggested that the New Tes-
tament  may  have  been  established  by  the  interaction  of  several  competing
groups of early Christians that had very different beliefs (e.g., Ebionites, Mar-
cionites).70 But from early church history we are able to see that the early Chris-
tians fended off those who held heretical beliefs and were able to maintain the
text of the New Testament. As far as we know, Marcion and those who held
different  canons  or  texts  were  offshoots  and  did  not  represent  mainstream
Christianity. This situation can be compared to Jewish scribes who maintained
the proto-MT against competing versions of the Old Testament in the early ﬁrst
century A.D.

A Brief History of Old Testament
Textual Criticism

This chapter provides a brief history of Old Testament textual criticism from
the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Septuagint to its present state. Most modern Old
Testament text critics consider it preferable to make a diplomatic edition (i.e.,
from  an  early,  extant  Hebrew  manuscript)  and  include  a  textual  apparatus
compiling variants from different sources.

When holding the modern Old Testament text in our hands, it is difﬁcult to
comprehend all the lives and talent dedicated to preparing it for more than
three thousand years. A high regard for Scripture, devotion to detail and prov-
idence  have  preserved  over  the  millennia  a  text  that  is  remarkably  reliable,
something more recently conﬁrmed by some of the Dead Sea Scrolls. We will
now turn brieﬂy to a history of Old Testament textual criticism from its earliest
stages to gain a frame of reference from which to work.

4.1 Dead Sea Scrolls

Until the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the oldest, extant Hebrew manu-
scripts of any signiﬁcant portion of the Old Testament was from the ninth
century  A.D.  Things  changed  drastically,  however,  with  the  discovery  of
manuscripts in the caves around Qumran in 1947. From these caves we now
have somewhere around 900 manuscripts in varying degrees of preservation
dated between the third century B.C. and the ﬁrst century A.D.1 

Several manuscripts from the Dead Sea area indicate corrections to the
texts, which are placed within the margins or between the lines. Some have
suggested that these changes were made based merely on the preferences of

the Qumran scribes (possibly for theological or grammatical reasons),2 but
even  a  cursory  glance  at  the  Isaiah  Scroll  from  Qumran  (1QIsa)  argues
against this possibility since there are many changes that do not appear to
show any consistent rationale (e.g., switching from Yahweh to Adonai and
then back again in the following lines). More likely, these corrections indi-
cate proofreading changes or that the texts were modiﬁed based on different
readings in various manuscripts. It is fairly well accepted among scholars
that the Dead Sea Scrolls give evidence that at least three textual traditions
were  prevalent  about  the  third  century  B.C.:  one  following  the  SP  (pre-
Samaritan Pentateuch or “harmonizing text”), one the LXX (a supposed He-
brew original behind the text of the LXX) and one the proto-MT (the conso-
nantal base text that was later developed and maintained by the medieval
Masoretes).3  However,  Emanuel  Tov  argues  for  at  least  ﬁve  textual  tradi-

tions: the three mentioned previously plus nonaligned texts and texts writ-
ten according to “Qumran practice.”4 It is the latter group of texts, which
Tov calls “Qumran practice,” that appears to give the best evidence for some
type of textual criticism occurring at Qumran, for they contain numerous
corrections. 

Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the scribes at Qumran may have
modiﬁed  their  texts  because  they  were  aware  of  other  traditions  or  manu-
scripts of the Old Testament. This possibility is also suggested by several of
the Qumran texts themselves. For example, the Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa) includes
a signiﬁcant number of corrections to the text, the majority of which bring its
readings into closer harmony with the MT’s readings, but several additions
actually go the other way, suggesting that the text being followed may have
had a different reading (e.g., Isaiah 8:16 adds t) [)t ]; Isaiah 11:4 adds tmwy
(#r , ywmt rs\(; Isaiah 44:3 adds Nk, kn). An interesting example is found in Isa-
iah 3:17-18:

Figure 4.2. Textual variants from Qumran (Isaiah 3:17-18) [John C. Trever]

In the third line (ﬁg. 4.2), dots appear below the MT reading ynwd) ()dwny,
“the Lord”) and the alternate reading hwhy (yhwh, “Yahweh”) appears above it.
But in the fourth line the readings are reversed: dots appear below the word
hwhy (yhwh) and the reading from the MT appears above it. Dots placed above
(Is 7:16; 35:10; 36:4, 7; 41:20) or below (Is 34:17; 40:7) a letter, word or phrase
may indicate similar changes. Other markings in the ﬁrst Isaiah Scroll point to
some degree of textual criticism being carried on at this early period. These
markings include the following:

• A word squeezed in sideways in the margin (Is 35:9; 37:9; 38:21-22; 40:8; see

If these markings are the result of text critical work at Qumran, then they

may be the earliest extant evidence for this type of activity.5

5There is certainly evidence that suggests corrections or editorial work occurred before this time;
e.g., Genesis 14:14 contains the name “Dan” before the city was even called Dan (see Josh 19:47;
Judg 18:29), but even the earliest Hebrew texts and the ancient versions have this reading.

4.2 Septuagint (LXX)

Before the discoveries of the Dead Sea Scrolls it was reasonable to use the LXX
and other ancient versions of the Bible as primary evidence for the text of the
Old Testament. This was because extant evidence for these ancient versions
preceded evidence for the MT by four hundred years or more in most cases.
The LXX was commonly used to provide evidence for readings that diverged
from the MT, and these readings were given priority since there was no other
comparative evidence by which to question them. However, the discovery of
the Dead Sea Scrolls and more recent studies have challenged this thinking in
several ways. First, recent studies have shown that the proto-MT underlies a
signiﬁcant portion of the readings in the LXX. Al Wolters has correctly stated:

Since 1970 a number of volumes have appeared in the Göttingen edition of the
LXX, accompanied by an impressive series of auxiliary studies. As this hitherto
most comprehensive and reliable edition of the  LXX nears completion, scholars
have begun to realize that its textual base shows much greater afﬁnity to the MT
than was previously assumed. For one thing, the study of the translation tech-
nique employed in many books of the LXX has made clear that Greek renderings
that used to be taken as evidence of a non-Masoretic Vorlage can in many cases be
explained as reﬂecting a Hebrew text that is identical with the MT.6

Scholars are beginning to realize that often what was commonly thought to
be a distinct reading of a Greek text that went back to a Hebrew Vorlage can
now be better understood as a translator’s free rendering of the proto-MT. Sec-
ond, even the Old Greek texts (i.e., what is thought to be the original Greek text
of  the  LXX)  have  apparently  undergone  revisions  and  recensions  that  have
brought them into greater conformity to the proto-MT (e.g., the kaige recension
appears to be dated to the mid-ﬁrst century B.C., indicating clear revisions to-
ward the proto-MT).7 Third, since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls it is no
longer possible to assume that the distinctive readings of the LXX are necessar-
ily older than the proto-MT since evidence for the proto-MT can be shown to be
just as early as, if not earlier than, the LXX. 

4.3 A Uniﬁed Text by the First Century A.D.

The  Dead  Sea  scrolls  indicate  a  signiﬁcant  variety  of  textual  traditions  by
about the third century B.C., and it appears that the scribes were allowed some
ﬂexibility in modifying the texts (e.g., the addition of matres lectionis, glosses
[clarifying additions], modifying archaic words). However, after the mid-ﬁrst

century  A.D.  things  had  signiﬁcantly  changed  and  modiﬁcations  were  no
longer  permitted,  as  evidenced  by  the  consistency  of  the  manuscripts  from
Masada (prior to 73  A.D.), from the caves at Nah[al H9ever (latter ﬁrst century
A.D.)  and  Wadi  Murabba(at  (prior  to  the  Bar  Kochba  Revolt  in  132-35  A.D.).
Bruce Waltke also points to rabbinic evidence that suggests uniﬁcation of the
text transpired during the ﬁrst century A.D.:

Indeed, the seven rules of biblical hermeneutics, compiled by Hillel the Elder at
the time of Herod, demanded an inviolable, sacrosanct, authoritative text. More-
over, Justin’s complaint against Trypho the Jew that the rabbis had altered the
venerable  LXX to remove an essential arm from the Christian propaganda also
demonstrates that the rabbis desired an authoritative text.8

Justin’s  complaint  regarding  the  Greek  translations  of  Aquila  (A.D.  120),
Symmachus (A.D. 180) and Theodotion (A.D. 180) was primarily aimed at their
translation  of  hmfl;(a  ((alma=,  âLXX  parqe/nov,  parthenos,  usually  “virgin”)  as
nea~niv (neanis, “young woman”) in Isaiah 7:14.

Justin Martyr said to Trypho (a Jewish scholar) concerning Isaiah 7:14: 

But I am far from putting reliance in your teachers, who refuse to admit that the
interpretation made by the seventy elders who were with Ptolemy [king] of the
Egyptians is a correct one; and they attempt to frame one another. And I wish you
to observe, that they have altogether taken away many Scriptures from the trans-
lations effected by those seventy elders who were with Ptolemy.9 

What is interesting about this quote from Justin Martyr is that the proto-MT
apparently was not merely changed to hrF(jna (na(a6ra=, “young girl, woman”),
which suggests that they were not free to modify the Hebrew text at will but
were able to retranslate the LXX.

Because of the meticulous work of the scribes, there was very little variation
among MT manuscripts from the ﬁrst to the ﬁfteenth centuries A.D., when mov-
able print began to be used for Bible translations. During the process of the
uniﬁcation of the textual tradition, however, certain readings were necessarily
chosen over others, and thus some type of text-critical work established a uni-
ﬁed tradition. Little is said about how this uniﬁed tradition arose. Some vari-
ants may have been maintained in the Kethib/Qere notes in the marginal Maso-
rah,  but  a  uniﬁed  authoritative  text  was  easier  to  maintain  than  ﬂexible  or
multiple texts. Some readings that were not chosen may have been the origi-
nals, and it is up to the Old Testament text critic today to attempt to retrieve
these early readings where possible.

A Brief History of Old Testament Textual Criticism

4.4 Origen’s Hexapla

The debates between Christians and Jews compelled Origen to compile one of
the earliest and most important examples of Old Testament textual criticism,
the Hexapla (A.D. 230-245). His reason for making the Hexapla is clearly stated
in a letter responding to Julius Africanus (c. 240): “I make it my endeavor not
to be ignorant of their [LXX’s] various readings, lest in my controversies with
the Jews I should quote to them what is not found in their copies, and that I
may make some use of what is found there, even although it should not be in
our Scriptures.”10 The six-column arrangement of texts enabled one to see the
relationship of the Hebrew text to the various Greek versions of the time (see
pp. 192-95). Ernst Würthwein points out the purpose of the Hexapla:

The Hebrew text stands in ﬁrst place as the original, and the sequence of the ver-
sion corresponds to their relationship to the original, priority going to Aquila as
the most literal. The primary interest of the Alexandrian scholar was to link Ö to
the original Hebrew text with the help of the other more literal versions.11

This monumental work apparently was destroyed in the Arab invasions of
the early seventh century A.D., but readings from the Hexapla can be found in
various manuscripts that were copied before the work was destroyed (e.g., G
[Codex Sarravianus], M [Codex Coislianus], 86 and 88).

4.5 Latin Vulgate

Jerome translated the Old Testament into Latin about A.D. 390-405, apparently
using a base text that was a form of the Hebrew text. Ernst Würthwein notes
the limitations of Jerome’s translation:

As there were no dictionaries or grammars in his day, his most important aids
were the Greek versions of the Septuagint, Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion,
and any information he could obtain from the Jewish side. As a result he kept
very much along traditional lines, and the inﬂuences of the resources mentioned
above are clearly observable in his work.12

Still,  Jerome  understood  the  difﬁculties  of  the  translation  process,  for  he

states:

Translation . . . is a difﬁcult, almost impossible, art to master. Languages vary
so in their order of words, in their individual metaphors, and in their native id-
ioms.  The  translator  is  thus  faced  with  a  choice  between  a  literal,  word-for-

word rendering (which is certain to sound absurd and so be a travesty of the
original) and something very much freer (in which case he is liable to be ac-
cused of being unfaithful).13

Jerome chose primarily a sense-for-sense translation method for Old Testa-
ment in the Latin Vulgate, though in some places he is slavishly literal.14 Since
there is no record of what Hebrew text Jerome used and because he chose to
translate in a sense-for-sense rather than a literal manner, some scholars ques-
tion  the  Vulgate’s  usefulness  to  textual  criticism.15  It  is  apparent  that  he
weighed the accuracy of his sources and based his translation on a Hebrew
text, often correcting the Old Latin and Greek texts. Thus in some sense Jerome
used principles of textual criticism to produce the Latin Vulgate, even though
it is unclear how he decided which text to use.

Hendly F. D. Sparks makes an interesting and helpful comment:

A Brief History of Old Testament Textual Criticism

97

In spite of his grasp of text-critical principles and his constant censure of the Latin
and Greek biblical texts of his day, Jerome found but little amiss with the current
Hebrew text. This text, so far as we can see, was substantially the same as our own
standard Massoretic text; and it is, therefore, to us all the more surprising that it
never seems seriously to have occurred to him, either that it might have been at
one time only one of several competing texts, or that it might be in any degree cor-
rupt. The reason presumably was that, whereas Jerome’s Latin and Greek manu-
scripts  differed  repeatedly  and  widely  among  themselves,  his  Hebrew  manu-
scripts did not. In other words, except in the merest handful of passages, and then
only in unimportant details, they posed no obvious textual problems.16

4.6 Masoretes

During  the  time  of  the  Masoretes  (A.D.  500-1100),  traditions  regarding  the
reading of the text and its pointing were established and recorded. They dili-
gently made meticulous notes regarding the text, from recording the number
of letters used in the book to indicating its middle letter, as H. Wheeler Robin-
son observed: “Everything countable seems to be counted.”17 Thus the textual
criticism  from  this  period  basically  maintained  the  traditional  Hebrew  text.
Two notable families of scribes from Tiberias in Palestine, the Ben Asher and
Ben Naphtali families, vied with each other in copying and preserving the au-
thoritative Hebrew text. Eventually
the  Ben Asher  tradition  won  out—
two of the oldest extant manuscripts
of  the  MT,  the  Cairo  Codex  of  the
Prophets  (both  former  and  latter
prophets,  A.D.  895)  and  the Aleppo
Codex  (complete  Old  Testament,
A.D. 930), come from the Ben Asher
family. 

4.7 Printed Hebrew Bibles

Shortly  after  the  invention  of  mov-
able print, a poor edition of the He-
brew text of Psalms appeared in 1477,
most  likely  from  Bologna,  Spain.  In
1488, Abraham ben H9ayyim of Bologna
was  enlisted  to  produce  the  ﬁrst
printed  Old  Testament  with  vowel

points and accents. In 1516-1517 the ﬁrst Rabbinic Bible (Old Testament with Ma-
sorahs and several Jewish commentaries, e.g., Rashi, Kimh[i) was published in
Venice  by  Daniel  Bomberg.  With  the  help  of Jacob  ben H9ayyim,  Bomberg  pub-
lished the Second Rabbinic Bible (1524-1525), which became the standard MT for
about four hundred years.18 These printed editions are signiﬁcant to Old Testa-
ment textual criticism because they combined several manuscripts in order to
produce a single text with the best readings available at the time.

4.8 Polyglot Bibles

The polyglot versions, published from the beginning of the sixteenth century
onward,  were  the  next  advance  in  Old  Testament  textual  criticism.  Cardinal
Ximenes, archbishop of Toledo, produced the Complutensian Polyglot Bible in
1514-1517. The scribes at Toledo had access to some of the earliest extant Hebrew
manuscripts, and this Bible was based largely on a critical examination of these
manuscripts. The Hebrew text does not include accents and the vowel points are
unreliable, but the consonantal text is sound. The next to appear was the Ant-
werp Polyglot (1569-1572), published by Christophe Plantin at Antwerp (Bel-
gium) and paid for by King Philip II of Spain. Its Hebrew text derived from the
Complutensian Polyglot and the Second Rabbinic Bible of Jacob ben H9ayyim. The

Paris Polyglot (1629-1645), published by Guy M. leJay, was essentially the same
as  the  Antwerp  Polyglot,  with  the  addition  of  the  SP  and  its  Targums,  the
Peshitta and an Arabic version with a Latin translation. Nine years later Brian
Walton produced the London Polyglot Bible (1654-1657), which included seven
columns of text: the Hebrew text with a Latin interlinear translation, the SP (only
in the ﬁrst volume), a Targum, the LXX, the Vulgate, the Peshitta and the Old Syr-
iac, all with their Latin translations. 

The text followed those of Jacob ben H9ayyim (Second Rabbinic Bible) and Jo-
hann Buxtorf (sixth Rabbinic Bible).19 These works are useful in comparing the
various readings of the versions but do not provide any signiﬁcant variants of
the Hebrew manuscripts.

4.9 Hebrew Editions with Textual Apparatuses

Not until 1720 did a text of the Hebrew Bible appear with a textual apparatus
that recorded the most important readings of ﬁve manuscripts at Erfurt as well
as nineteen printed manuscripts. This edition, published by Johann Heinrich
Michaelis  (1668-1738),  a  German  pietist,  was  called Biblia  Hebraica  ex  aliquot
manuscriptis et compluribus impressis codicibus. . . .20
 About ﬁfty years later an-
other Hebrew text was published with a massive textual apparatus. This work
was produced by Benjamin Kennicott (1718-1783), canon of Christ’s Church,
Oxford, in 1776-1780 and was called Vetus Testamentum Hebraicum cum variis
lectionibus.21  Without  vowel  points  or  accents,  it  records  variants  from  615
manuscripts, 52 editions of the Hebrew text and 16 manuscripts of the SP.22 In
1784-1788 Giovanni B. de Rossi, an Italian scholar, published Variae lectiones
Veteris Testamenti . . . ,23 which compiles variant readings in the consonantal text
from 1,475 manuscripts and editions (intro., p. xlv). This work was more com-
prehensive and accurate than Kennicott’s, but neither is of much value to Old
Testament textual criticism, as Würthwein explains:

The actual value of both Kennicott’s and de Rossi’s collections of variants of these
editions  for  the  recovery  of  the  original  text  is  very  small.  Apart  from  ortho-
graphic differences and simple scribal errors (such as haplography, dittography,
inversion of consonants), the variants they record are concerned with the use of
the  plural  or  singular  with  collective  nouns,  the  addition  or  omission  of  such
words as lk [ko4l] or w [wa4w], the interchange of prepositions with similar mean-
ings or of words with synonymous expressions. . . . This certainly demonstrates

the lack of any absolute uniformity in the transmission of the text, such as is as-
sumed by the theory of single archetype. But what is lacking is variants of any
real signiﬁcance for the meaning of the text, such as are found in New Testament
manuscripts. These collections of variants provide scarcely any help in dealing
with corrupt passages.24

The disappointing outcome of these works led to a declining interest in Old
Testament textual criticism so that no further works of this nature have been
forthcoming.

Seligmann Baer, aided by Franz Delitzsch, prepared an eclectic text of the
MT (except for Exodus to Deuteronomy), drawing the preferable readings from
various sources. This work, Textum Masoreticum accuratissime expressit e fonti-
bus Masorae codicumque varie illustravit (1869-1895),25 did not meet with a favor-
able response. The Dead Sea Scrolls had not yet been discovered and the me-
dieval Hebrew manuscripts that it used reﬂected a uniﬁed Masoretic tradition
and furnished few signiﬁcant variations.26 Recently there has been a revived
interest in producing an eclectic edition by Oxford University Press, called The
Oxford Hebrew Bible, with Ronald Hendel as editor in chief.27

4.10 Diplomatic Editions 

Diplomatic editions reproduce a particular textus receptus (lit. “received text,” or
a form of the MT) of the original Hebrew text, in contrast to an eclectic edition
that attempts to reconstruct the original reading of the Old Testament text by
combining the most accurate readings in one text. The ﬁrst edition of the Biblia
Hebraica (BHK1) was published in Leipzig, Germany, in 1906 by the German Bi-
ble Society (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft) and edited by Rudolph Kittel. It used
the Hebrew text of the Second Rabbinic Bible (1524-1525) edited by Jacob ben
H9ayyim. A second edition of the BHK2 was published in 1913 and contained only
minor  corrections.  Not  everyone  was  happy  with  these  editions—largely  be-
cause they used an eclectic Hebrew text and contained many emendations in the
textual apparatus. Roland Harrison notes the criticisms of the textual apparatus:

The  ﬁrst  important  scholar  to  criticize  this  curious  situation  was  C.  C.  Torrey,
who made a scathing attack on the methods used to amass this apparatus. Tor-
rey’s views were shared by Montgomery, who in his Critical and Exegetical Com-
mentary on the Book of Daniel (1927) ignored the apparatus completely. These opin-
ions were also elaborated by Margolis, who made it clear that the Kittel critical

apparatus was completely unreliable for scholarly purposes. Orlinsky also took
the same stand in 1934, and has continued his criticism of this collection of mate-
rial since that time. Ziegler and Katz have been equally forthright in their warn-
ings as to the complete inadequacy of the Kittel apparatus.28

Christian  D.  Ginsburg  prepared  an  edition  of  the  MT  for  the  British  and
Foreign Bible Society (1908 and following; new ed. 1920) that is essentially the
text of Jacob ben H9ayyim with a textual apparatus collating variant readings
from more than seventy manuscripts and nineteen editions published before
1524,  though  most  are  from  the  thirteenth  century  or  later.  Würthwein  cri-
tiques this work:

Although this edition has a certain importance as a collection of Masoretic mate-
rial, its value is lessened by the unevenness of the material, which was gathered
almost haphazardly, and the absence of any attempt to weigh or group it. By far
the majority of the variants are trivial, and do not affect the sense or the interpre-
tation of the text. Variants in early versions are very rarely noticed.29

This work was followed by BHK3, edited in 1929-1937 by Rudolf Kittel and
Paul Kahle, and published in Stuttgart, Germany. It was a signiﬁcant improve-
ment using a new Hebrew base text and a new textual apparatus, but it still
signiﬁcantly depended on emendations. The Hebrew text was not that of the
Second  Rabbinic  Bible  as  in  earlier  editions,  but  the  Codex  Leningradensis
(Ms. B19A) dated A.D. 1008 from what appears to be the Ben Asher tradition.
The editors had hoped to use the Aleppo Codex, but it was not available.30 

Following this work, in 1958 Norman H. Snaith prepared for the British and
Foreign  Bible  Society  another  edition  based  primarily  on  Ms.  Or.  2626-2628
from the British Museum. This manuscript was copied in Lisbon in 1482 and
also reﬂects the Ben Asher tradition.

The most recent complete critical edition of the MT is BHS (1967-1977), ed-
ited by Karl Elliger and Wilhelm Rudolph. Its base text is again the Codex Len-
ingradensis (Ms. B19A); it contains a new presentation of the Masorah and a
new apparatus incorporating evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls. The textual
apparatus no longer has separate apparatuses for minor and signiﬁcant vari-
ants, and a considerable number of conjectures without textual support have
been removed. 

A new edition of the Biblia Hebraica (titled Biblia Hebraica Quinta) is in pro-
cess, and one fascicle containing the Megilloth (e.g., Ruth, Song of Solomon,
Ecclesiastes, Lamentations and Esther) has already appeared. It is a diplomatic
edition  of  the  Codex  Leningradensis  (Ms.  B19A)  largely  because  the Aleppo
Codex is incomplete. The editors have chosen to make a diplomatic edition for
the following reasons: (1) too little is known about the history of the develop-
ment of the Hebrew Bible and the various textual traditions to construct an ac-
curate eclectic text; (2) one would have to choose a particular point in the de-
velopment of the Hebrew Bible’s history to construct an eclectic text, and at
present there is no consensus which would be the best point for the reconstruc-
tion; and (3) to be adequate an eclectic text would need to present all variants
found in surviving witnesses, and the editors believed that would be beyond
the limits of a one-volume Hebrew text.31 

Another major critical edition of the Hebrew Bible is being produced that
uses the Aleppo Codex (tenth century) as its base text and is called The He-
brew University Bible Project (described in detail on pp. 112-13). It contains
four apparatuses with no conjectural readings or evaluations of the merits of
the readings. So far only Jeremiah, Isaiah and Ezekiel have been published.

Another important project that has been in progress for over thirty years is

called the Hebrew Old Testament Text Project and is sponsored by the United
Bible Societies (UBS). The goal of this project is to make a text-critical commen-
tary on the Old Testament. An initial report was published in 1973-1980;32 how-
ever, the committee is still in the process of making a much more detailed ﬁnal
report; three volumes have already appeared.33 Wolters describes this work:

These massive volumes are a monument to careful text-critical scholarship and
embody a wealth of information about the history of the biblical text and its in-
terpretation. Although the body of the work is devoted to assessing the diver-
gences from the MT that have been accepted in the major contemporary Bible
versions, there are also extensive essays by Barthélemy on the history of Old
Testament textual criticism and on the whole range of witnesses to the Old Tes-
tament text. . . . The committee took as its goal the recovery of phase 2, essen-
tially the proto-Masoretic text. . . . With impressive erudition, Barthélemy dis-
cusses  hundreds  of  emendations  to  the  MT  that  have  been  proposed  and
accepted in the modern commentaries and translations and ﬁnds most of them
wanting. In volume 2, out of eight hundred emendations that were examined,
only seventy-eight are found to be probable, and most of these do not materi-
ally affect the sense [see P. Dion, review of Critique textuelle, vol. 2, in JBL 107
(1988): 738]. In short, these volumes constitute a massive vindication of the tra-
ditional Hebrew text.34

4.11 Present State of Old Testament Textual Criticism

Most scholars today have abandoned any attempt to develop an eclectic He-
brew text (combining the best readings from each of the Hebrew manuscripts,
similar to the United Bible Society’s text of the New Testament). In the case of
the Old Testament text, scholars have argued that the literary history is very
complicated and far too little of it is known. Some scholars have suggested that
different versions of part or all of some books may have coexisted or that there
may have been different stages in the literary development of a book (e.g., Jer-
emiah and Ezekiel both have shorter and longer forms).35 Tov states: “Large-
scale  differences  between  the  textual  witnesses  show  that  a  few  books  and
parts of books were once circulated in different formulations representing dif-

ferent literary stages, as a rule one after the other, but possibly also parallel to
each other.”36 The situation is complicated even further by the fact that we do
not know when the development, modiﬁcation and compilation of the books
ceased.37 In addition, for the vast majority of Old Testament books the oldest
extant text was copied at least several hundred years after it was ﬁrst written.
It  is  therefore  considered  preferable  to  choose  a  particular  extant  manu-
script of the Old Testament (a textus receptus) and add a textual apparatus, not-
ing where the text differs from other readings.38 The assumption is that it is
better to produce a known form of the Old Testament than to attempt a hypo-
thetical eclectic text that may never have existed. Thus recent diplomatic edi-
tions of the Old Testament use the Codex Leningradensis (dated to A.D. 1008;
BHK, BHS) or the Aleppo Codex (dated A.D. 930; The Hebrew University Bible
Project) as the textus receptus and note variants in a critical apparatus.

Excursus 1: Modern Diplomatic Editions
of the Hebrew Bible

The present Hebrew Bible is called the Masoretic Text (MT) because it was pre-
served  by  the  Masoretes  (possibly  from rsamf, ma4sar,  “to  hand  down”)  from
about A.D. 500 to 1100. The Masoretes were a group of scribes who copied and
maintained the traditions of the Hebrew text that had been passed down to
them. Technically the MT is a group of closely related manuscripts whose name
derives from the apparatus called the Masorah attached to it. Tov says: “This
apparatus, which was added to the consonantal base, developed from earlier
traditions  in  the  seventh  to  the  eleventh  centuries—the  main  developments
occurring in the beginning of the tenth century with the activity of the Ben
Asher family in Tiberias.”1 The MT includes the consonantal text, scribal nota-
tions (e.g., vowel points, accents) and the Masorah. Modern editions of the MT
(e.g., BHS, BHQ and the Hebrew University Bible Project) also include textual
apparatuses that note different readings between the manuscript used for the
MT and the other traditions, texts and versions. Each of these will be discussed
in more detail below.

The present Hebrew text of the Old Testament is based on the Masorah, the
purpose  of  which  is  to  ensure  the  accuracy  of  the  transmission  of  the  text.2
Rabbi  Akiba  described  “tradition”  (trewOs@ma,  masso=ret)  as  “a  fence  about  the
Law.”3 The Masoretic material was translated orally at ﬁrst, but as it continued
to grow it was increasingly recorded along with the text. The sacredness of the
biblical text and the importance of following the laws in order to be approved
by Yahweh required that the text be preserved accurately. Since so much rested
on the accuracy of their Scriptures and the ability to transfer these laws to later
generations, it is easy to see why the Masoretes took such care in establishing
rules for its transmission. That biblical manuscripts have been copied for thou-
sands of years with only minor variations suggests that the Masorah was quite
successful in preserving the text.

in Congress Volume: Bonn 1966, VTSup 9 (Leiden: Brill, 1963), pp. 266-84.

3See m. )Abot 3:14. Rabbi Akiba predated the Masorah by ﬁve centuries  and thus used the
word in the sense of “tradition,” not in its later technical sense. Also there is some question
whether Rabbi Akiba was referring to the oral Law or to the written Law, but the saying still
indicates the rabbinic view of the importance of the tradition.

Masorah Parva
This part of the 
masorah often notes 
orthographic 
peculiarities and was 
intended to help 
scribes ensure textual 
accuracy. Most note 
how many times a 
particular form 
occurs, or when there 
is a kethib/qere 
reading.
How to use it: First, 
locate the circulus 
found over or 
between words in the 
text and follow it 
over to the side 
margin where the 
notation appears 
about that word or 
phrase (if between 
words).

Masorah Magna
This part of the 
masorah is used in 
conjunction with the 
Masorah parva and 
generally provides 
lists of where the 
particular forms 
mentioned in the 
Masorah parva are 
found.
How to use it: Match 
the numbers of each 
note to the small 
numbers on the side.

Textual Notes: This part of the MT contains textual information from the 
editors of the BHS to help determine the most accurate reading of the text.

BHK, BHS and BHQ all contain the Masorah represented in the text of the
Leningrad Public Library Ms. B 19A (A.D. 1008), which is a complete Ben Asher
manuscript.4 Textual notes also appear at the bottom of the pages of the critical
editions of the MT that compare it to other extant Hebrew manuscripts and ver-
sions. The Masorah and textual notes are written in Aramaic, not Hebrew, and
are greatly abbreviated. Still, with proper guidance and careful explanation,
the information of the Masorah can greatly add to one’s knowledge of the MT.
The  Western  Masoretes  divided  the  Masorah  into  two  main  parts:  the  mar-
ginal Masorah and the ﬁnal Masorah.

1 Marginal Masorah (Masora marginalis)

Written within the margins of the text, the marginal Masorah records details
on how words were to be written or read, or how often words or phrases occur.
Over  time  these  notations  became  so  numerous  that  the  Masoretes  were
obliged to record them in other Masoretic handbooks. The marginal Masorah

sia, ed. Aron Dotan [Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson, 2000]).

furnishes a wealth of information comprising two parts: the masorah parva
and masorah magna.

Figure E1.3. Masorah parva (Genesis 1). The ﬁrst circulus refers to the ﬁrst reading in the
; (be6re4s\|<t) occurs h (5 times) in the Old Tes-
margin with the notation that the word ty#$
i)r'b@
tament; g (3 times) p``r (at the head [beginning] of a verse) and b (2 times) p``m (in the mid-
dle of the verse). [American Bible Society]

1.1 Masorah parva (Mp) 
The  masorah  parva5  (sometimes  called  masorah  qe6tanna=,  “little  Masorah”)  is
written along the outer margin of the text. The masorah parva primarily con-
cerns Hebrew orthography (the rules and conventions of spelling), including
the  number  of  occurrences  of  orthographic  peculiarities,  combinations  of
words, qere forms and some scribal corrections, variants among parallel pas-
sages and special details (e.g., a verse that contains all the letters of the Hebrew
alphabet, the middle letter of a book, the shortest verse).6 As Tov explains:

Since the purpose of the Masorah was to ensure the precise transmission of the bibli-
cal text, it focused on the aspect most problematic for scribes, that is, orthography. The
Masoretes and their followers described in various treatises the rules of the biblical or-
thography and they wrote marginal notes—in Aramaic—on the exceptions to these
rules. Their main attention was directed toward the question of how many times a
certain orthography occurred in a given biblical book or in the Bible as a whole.7

5See Israel Yeivin, Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah, ed. and trans. Ernest J. Revell, SBLMS

5 (Chico, Calif.: Scholars Press, 1980), pp. 64-74.

6The standard for determining which words should appear in the Masorah parva is delineated
in the following Masoretic handbook: Elias Levita, Massoreth ha-Massoreth (Venice, 1538), re-
printed as Massoreth ha-Massoreth, ed. Christian D. Ginsburg (London: Longmans, Green,
Reader & Dyer, 1867), which was reprinted as Massoreth ha-Massoreth, ed. Christian D. Gins-
burg (New York: KTAV, 1968). An example of a rule in this work states: “There is no noun
to be found in the whole Bible, with Cholem as the last vowel, which is not written plene,
with the mater lectionis Vav, except in a few instances which deviate from this rule, as I shall
explain in the following section” (pp. 146-47). This means that the word dwOp)' ()e4po=d, plene
spelling) would not be written as dOp)' without being noted in the masorah parva.

The number of occurrences refers to the exact form of a particular word or
phrase (i.e., with particular vowel points or accents). The value of the masorah
parva to textual criticism is that it is much more speciﬁc than a concordance,
but Tov cautions that it may not always be correct:

In the use of the Massora parva it is well to bear in mind that the notes are often
neither consistent nor accurate. One reason for this is that the Massora parva was
initially transmitted with its companion manuscript but later also separately or
even copied in other manuscripts. Thus not one but several Massora texts were in
circulation. The invention of the art of printing increased the confusion because
the  Second  Rabbinic  Bible,  which  would  later  become  the  textus  receptus,  con-
tained an eclectic Massora parva, composed by Ben Hayyim from various sources.8

1.2 Masorah magna. The masorah magna is actually a book of lists indicating

where speciﬁc forms occur that are cited in the masorah parva.

Figure E1.4. Masorah magna (Genesis 1). The small numbers in the masorah parva (side
of the page) correspond to the same numbers in the masorah magna (bottom of the page).
The ﬁrst superscript number 1 in the masorah parva corresponds to the superscript num-
ber 1 in the masorah magna and states that it is the ﬁrst list in the masorah magna. If we
; (be6re4)s\|<t) occurs
went to that list it would include the three places that the word ty#$
at the beginning of the verse. The second superscript number indicates the second list in
; (be6re4)s\|<t) occurs in the mid-
the masorah magna recording the two places where ty#i
dle of the verse. On that same page superscript number 7 is interesting in that the maso-
rah parva says that the phrase w%hbowF w%hto (to4hu= wa4bo4hu=, “formless and void”) occurs only
here and in Jeremiah 4:23; then it says compare that place also (cf. Mp sub loco). [Amer-
ican Bible Society]

2 Final Masorah (Masorah ﬁnalis) 

This Masorah, a compilation of lists too large for the masorah parva and the maso-
rah magna, is collected in what are sometimes called Masoretic handbooks. One
of these is an alphabetical list of words that occur only twice, one without the w
(wa4w, meaning “and”) and the other with it. This collection, called Okhla weOkhla

published by Salomon Frensdorff and contains 374 separate lists.9 Part of the ﬁnal
Masorah is commonly recorded at the end of the book divisions in the Leningrad
Public Library Ms. B19A and thus is recorded in BHS (and also in BHK).10 It indi-
cates the care and precision of the Masoretes, who even counted the letters of the
MT to ensure their works were accurate. For example, part of the information in-
cluded at the end of the Pentateuch (i.e., after Deuteronomy) is:

3 Description of the Textual Apparatus

Copies of the MT known as diplomatic editions contain a copy of one tradition
of the MT along with a textual apparatus that compares it to other forms of the
MT as well as other texts and versions. To date, there are two major diplomatic
editions: the Hebrew University Bible Project and Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia
(BHS). Both provide insights into the Hebrew text, but for our purposes the
best tool is BHS since it contains the whole MT. A description of each edition
follows.

3.1 The Hebrew University Bible Project

The basic text for this work is the Aleppo Codex, which comes from the Ben
Asher tradition and is dated to the ﬁrst part of the tenth century. At present
only  three  biblical  books  have  appeared:  Moshe  H.  Goshen-Gottstein,  ed.,
The  Hebrew  University  Bible:  The  Book  of  Isaiah,  2  vols.  (Jerusalem:  Magnes,
1975, 1981); Chayim Rabin et al., eds., The Hebrew University Bible: The Book of
Jeremiah  (Jerusalem:  Magnes,  1997);  and  Moshe  H.  Goshen-Gottstein  and
Shemaryahu  Talmon,  eds.,  The  Hebrew  University  Bible:  The  Book  of  Ezekiel
(Jerusalem: Magnes, 2004). This work has four separate apparatuses that di-
vide the textual evidence according to the nature of the witnesses. The ﬁrst
apparatus compiles evidence from the ancient versions, including the Arabic
translation of Saadia Gaon, LXX, Vulgate, Peshitta, Targum Jonathan and MT.
The second apparatus contains Hebrew texts from the Second Temple period
(516  B.C.-A.D.  70),  namely,  rabbinic  literature  and  texts  from  the  Judean
Desert. The third apparatus includes textual witnesses from medieval cod-
ices  (none  dating  earlier  than  A.D.  800)  that  highlight  consonantal  differ-
ences.  The  fourth  apparatus  collates  evidence  from  the  medieval  codices
concerning  differences  in  vocalization  and  accents.  The  textual  notes  have
the following characteristics:

• They do not contain emendations.

• The editors do not take any position as to the comparative value of the var-

ious readings.

• The readings are sometimes designated by various grammatical categories,
such  as  num  (=  numerus),  meaning  “number”  when  the  witnesses  inter-
change singular and plural forms.11

3.2 Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS) 

This work  is  based  on the Masoretic tradition found in Codex Leningradensis 
B19A (even in places where the text is known to be wrong, for example, Gen
4:18; Is 2:15; Jon 3:6) and includes the masorah parva and the masorah magna.12
The Codex Leningradensis B19A is a complete manuscript from the Ben Asher
tradition dated to A.D. 1008 (see p. 97). The editors of BHS have compiled a tex-
tual apparatus at the bottom of the page that includes both the variant read-
ings as well as their evaluations.

Chapter 1, verse 1

Figure E1.6. Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia apparatus [American Bible Society]

In ﬁgure E1.6 the phrase from Genesis 1:7 indicated by “7a-a” means that
the editors are identifying the phrase found in verse seven from letter “a” to
letter “a” (equaling the entire phrase) in order to comment on it. “Cf” means
compare  verse  6a.  The  editors  of  the BHS  then  suggest  adding  (“ins”)  the
phrase bw+-yk Myhl) )ryw (“and God saw that it was good”), as found in
(cf) verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 31 and in verse 8 of the LXX (Ö). The text critic
should use caution here because there is no evidence from Hebrew manu-
scripts to suggest this change, and the Septuagint is known for harmonizing
texts (or changing the wording of certain verses to make them correspond
more closely to other texts).

3.3 Biblia Hebraica Quinta (BHQ) 

The forthcoming ﬁfth edition of the Biblia Hebraica will have signiﬁcant simi-
larities to the earlier editions (e.g., it is a diplomatic edition with Codex Lenin-
gradensis as a base text, the structure and style is largely the same, and it pro-
vides the editors’ decisions on certain readings). Because much has changed in
the area of textual criticism over the last thirty years, the masorah and textual
notes will have to be entirely reworked.

Determining the Most Plausible
Original Reading

This chapter provides a step-by-step procedure for determining the most plausi-
ble reading of an Old Testament text. First, the chapter discusses where to start
and where to look for evidence. Next, it differentiates between internal and ex-
ternal evidence. Then it introduces how to weigh the evidence in order to deter-
mine the most plausible reading.

Before going camping, some preliminary decisions will make the whole trip
smoother.  First,  where  are  you  going?  Second,  how  long  are  you  staying?
Third, what kind of equipment will you need? Similarly, in Old Testament tex-
tual criticism it is helpful to lay some groundwork before we start. Where are
we going, or what is the goal? 

The goal of Old Testament textual criticism is to try to work back as closely
as possible to the ﬁnal form of the text that was maintained by the scribes and
later  canonized.  This  would  be  the  point  where  literary  development  (and
other higher critical issues) ended and the copying process began. However,
anyone  who  has  worked  with  literary  materials  knows  that  the  process  is
never quite this clear-cut and that these two processes very likely overlap to
some extent. Second, how long are we staying? This refers us to some guide-
lines to help determine how much food or how many clothes we need to bring.
The primary guideline for Old Testament textual criticism is, which reading
will most likely give rise to the others? This will help us work back to the most
plausible original reading. And ﬁnally, what equipment will we need? As we
learned in the previous chapter, the most suitable text to begin with is the Biblia
Hebraica Stuttgartensia (BHS)—its textual notes provide much of the evidence
necessary  to  determine  the  proper  reading  of  the  text.  Because  these  notes
sometimes contain Hebrew, Greek, Latin or even Syriac translations, dictionar-
ies for these languages will also be helpful.

Determining the Most Plausible Original Reading

5.1 Where Do We Start? 

The ﬁrst step in Old Testament textual criticism is to determine where errors
appear in the text, but this is not always easy because some errors may read
quite smoothly. A New Testament text critic can begin with the variant read-
ings of a text. Old Testament textual criticism, however, is more subjective be-
cause of the high uniformity of the text, as James Barr explains: “textual dis-
cussion will more frequently begin from the feeling that there is a ‘difﬁculty’;
the procedure will be more independent of the existence of variant readings.”1 
The best way to identify possible errors in the Old Testament text is to look for
problems in translation, apparent textual corruptions or textual variations (e.g.,
various  MT  readings  [Qumran  texts, Kethib/Qere  readings,  other  Hebrew  mss.,
etc.], SP, LXX, Latin Vulgate and Syriac Peshitta) to see where they differ and then
try to determine why. Modern diplomatic texts (BHS, BHQ, Hebrew University
Bible Project) have already done much of this work in their textual apparatuses. 
To be effective, textual criticism should include the following steps: (1) col-
lect evidence from various sources, including the MT tradition, recensions and
ancient versions, (2) evaluate both internal and external evidence, (3) deter-
mine the most plausible reading, and (4) suggest a conjectural reading only
when the attested readings do not make sense. We will work through each of
these steps.

5.2 Collecting the Evidence

The job of the text critic requires the perceptivity of a private detective in piec-
ing together the steps that led up to the present text. We must carefully exam-
ine every piece of evidence before drawing a ﬁnal conclusion. Evidence comes
from the following sources (see ﬁg. 5.1).

5.2.1 Examining the Masoretic Tradition

The MT is a good place to begin since it derives from the longest and, to date,
most reliable tradition overall. The ﬁrst step is to determine the most accu-
rate text of the MT; it has a number of forms, each of which varies slightly
from the others. Most modern critical editions of the MT (e.g., BHS, BHQ, He-
brew University Bible Project) are diplomatic editions (i.e., reproductions of
one known codex of the MT—often the Codex Leningradensis, dated to A.D.
1008)  that  reproduce  the  text  exactly,  even  when  it  is  known  to  be  wrong
(e.g., see textual notes for Psalm 5:10c where the editors note that the accent
\xjya instead of Nw%q|ylixjya] and Psalm 20:9a where a
is incorrectly placed [Nw%qyli
daghesh is added for no apparent reason [w%nm;q@
a instead of w%nm;qa]). Generally
modern critical editions of the MT have already compared the MT traditions
and provide a summary of the pertinent information in their textual appara-

codicibus . . . (Halle: Magdeburg, 1720)

123

tuses. Books by Michaelis, Kennicott, de Rossi and Ginsburg are commonly
referenced since they collate variant readings from many Hebrew medieval
texts (see pp. 164-65). 

The textual apparatus indicates any corrections or variations from this stan-
dard text. For the most part the MT is very stable and a comparison of various
manuscripts of the MT provides few variants of any consequence. In general,
any signiﬁcant variations in manuscripts arose before the text became uniﬁed
or from traditions other than the MT (e.g., LXX, Qumran texts, SP, Vulgate, Syr-
iac);  they  should  be  carefully  examined.  The  preceding  list  (see  table  5.1),
while  not  complete  because  there  are  over  three  thousand  Hebrew  manu-
scripts, provides a signiﬁcant number of the MT sources arranged in chrono-
logical  order.  It  would  be  difﬁcult,  if  not  impossible,  to  check  all  of  these
sources, but BHS has already examined most of them (as well as the versions)
in its textual apparatus. The list is provided for two reasons: (1) ease of access
to their names if it becomes necessary to consult the Hebrew sources, and (2)
to engender an appreciation for the detailed work that has gone into BHS and
other critical editions.

Example. An example of a corruption from the Codex Leningradensis that
can be corrected merely by looking at other copies of the MT is found in Gene-
sis 2:18:

.wOd@g:nek@

; rze(' wOl@-h@#&

e(v)e wOd@bal; Mdf)fhf twOyhv bwO+-)Ol Myhilo)v hwfhy: rme)Oy,wa

“And the LORD God said, ‘It is not good for the man to be alone, I will make (her)
for him a help(er) corresponding to him.’”

In this case, the daghesh (dot) in the ﬁnal he= of this word leads to an awk-
ward translation (i.e., see translation above in italics); the textual note on this
passage  suggests  this  is  a  mistake  found  in  the  Codex  Leningradensis,  but
many  Hebrew  manuscripts  do  not  include  the daghesh.  In  this  example  one
need go no further; the best reading of the MT is a suitable reading for the text;
in other cases, however, it may be necessary to also compare variant readings
from other sources.

5.2.2 Examining Other Sources

The past century has provided an amazing wealth of material for the Old Tes-
tament textual critic, and as many sources as possible should be examined. It
is probably best to arrange the source material into primary sources (i.e., those
written in Hebrew) and secondary sources (i.e., those written in some other
language) so that we have some method for beginning to evaluate them. Table
5.2 contains the most important sources.

“And God ﬁnished on the seventh day all his work which he did and he rested
on the seventh (day) from all his work which he did.”

The editors of the BHS point out that while all the Hebrew manuscripts in-
dicate this reading, the SP, LXX and the Syriac Peshitta read that God ﬁnished
his work on the sixth day instead of the seventh. Since later it is said that God

125

rested on the seventh day from the work that he had done, it seems reasonable
that his work was actually completed on the sixth day. It is possible that a Jew-
ish audience would have considered the resting as part of the work of creation,
but it seems more likely that the versions are correct in seeing the resting as a
separate element from the work of creation. Thus we have an example where
other witnesses may suggest a more plausible reading of a passage. 

5.3 Evaluating the Internal and External Evidence 

This is where skill, knowledge and balance on the part of the text critic are
needed to determine the most plausible reading of a text. Intuition and com-
mon sense must guide the text critic; at the same time, informed judgments
must be based on familiarity with types of copyist errors, manuscripts, ver-
sions and their authors. Bruce Metzger quips, “To teach another to become a
textual critic is like teaching another to become a poet.”2 While natural talent
is certainly a factor, the skills and rules related to textual criticism can be honed
and sharpened by regular interaction with the texts. The following guidelines
can help the Old Testament textual critic to evaluate the evidence:

• Determine the reading that would most likely give rise to the other read-

ings.

• Carefully evaluate the weight of the manuscript evidence.

• Determine if the reading is a secondary reading or a gloss.

• Determine which reading is most appropriate in its context. 

This ﬁrst guideline is foundational to all the others, and common sense will
provide the best guidance when trying to determine the most plausible read-
ing of the text. Tov considers these types of rules to be subjective and valuable
in only a small percentage of readings that need to be evaluated. He admits,
however, that they are more helpful in the evaluation of some external wit-
nesses.3 Tov seems to favor this last guideline:

The quintessence of textual evaluation is the selection from the different trans-
mitted readings of the one reading . . . which is the most appropriate to its con-
text. Within the process of this selection, the concept of the “context” is taken in
a broad sense, as referring to the language, style, and content of both the imme-
diate context and of the whole literary unit in which the reading is found.4

Each of the rules can be shown to have weaknesses. In the end common
sense and an understanding of Hebrew words, grammar and style are the best
tools for the Old Testament text critic. These guidelines may nevertheless be
useful under certain circumstances and thus are helpful to know. 

Once a corruption or signiﬁcant variant has been identiﬁed, the next step is
to evaluate both internal evidence (i.e., examining the passage or broader con-
text of the passage) and external evidence (i.e., examining other sources con-
taining this passage) to aid in determining the most plausible reading.

Example. Ruth 4:4 contains a variant that can probably be resolved by care-

fully examining both the internal and the external evidence:

“So I myself said I will reveal (in) your hearing saying, ‘Acquire (it) before the
ones sitting (here), even before the elders of my people. If you will redeem (it) re-
deem (it), but if he will not redeem (it) tell me so I will know for there is no one
but you to redeem (it) and I am after you.’ And he said, ‘I will redeem (it).’”

Most Hebrew manuscripts read  l)ag:yI )Ol-M)iw: ,  “but if he will not redeem
(it),”  whereas  some  Hebrew  manuscripts,  the  LXX,  the  Latin  Vulgate  and
the  Syriac  Peshitta  appear  to  derive  from  a  Hebrew  Vorlage  that  reads
i  )Ol-M)iw: , “but if you will not redeem (it),” a wording that makes more
l)ag:t@
sense in the context. The latter reading is supported as follows: (1) the con-
text (internal evidence) suggests that Boaz is speaking to his relative (the sec-
ond person form is used just prior to this) in the presence of the elders of the
city;  and  (2)  there  is  signiﬁcant  support  from  some  of  the  Hebrew  manu-
scripts and the other ancient versions (external evidence). However, it is also
possible  that  since  this  transaction  is  being  witnessed  by  the  elders  of  the
city, conﬁrmation that he will not redeem the ﬁeld would probably have to
come from them and thus the third person form may be correct. Jack Sasson
argues that the MT vividly pictures Boaz addressing the elders.5 It is also easy
to  see  why  some  of  the  Hebrew  manuscripts  and  other  ancient  witnesses
would have changed the form to the second person to smooth out the read-
ing. This variant is more difﬁcult than it may appear at ﬁrst sight—in weigh-
ing both readings it is necessary to examine both internal and external evi-
dence to reach to a ﬁnal decision.

5.3.1 Internal Evidence 

Internal evidence includes the types of changes described in chapter two (e.g.,
haplography, dittography, metathesis), as well as any evidence derived from
the structure of the text itself (e.g., common sentence structures, word usages,
or  literary  structures,  such  as  ellipsis  [i.e.,  omission  of  an  implied  word  or
phrase],  alphabetic  acrostic,  chiasm  [i.e.,  inverted  sequence  or  crossover  of
parallel words or phrases—a b b' a' pattern]; see table 5.3).

Questions of spelling or word usage, for example, may be resolved by ex-
amining spelling or usage in the rest of the book or in comparable genres of
the Old Testament. The following questions may be useful in unraveling a dif-
ﬁcult reading: 

• Is there any evidence of transmissional corruption (e.g., metathesis, haplog-
raphy, fusion; see pp. 44-50)? Corruptions of this type are fairly easy to spot
and may reasonably resolve a problem passage. 

• Is it plausible that a scribe purposely or inadvertently changed the text (e.g.,
omission, changes for euphemistic reasons, archaic usage; see pp. 50-55)? 

• Do any linguistic forms or literary structures of the passage help determine
the original reading of the text? For example, the editors of BHS suggest in-
cluding the following phrase in Genesis 1:6 because a similar pattern ap-

One should exercise caution in this case, however, because the only textual ev-
idence for this insertion is from the LXX, which is known for harmonizing texts.

5.3.2 External Evidence 

When a difﬁcult passage is not resolved by merely examining the internal ev-
idence, the text critic must turn to external evidence of manuscripts and ver-
sions outside the MT. However, James Barr notes potential problems in using
the versions for textual criticism:

The scholar cannot use the ancient versions as if they were actual Hebrew texts.

The translators may have misunderstood the original Hebrew, so that their ver-
sion is not a good, but a very bad, guide to what the original text said. Finding a
difﬁcult passage in Hebrew, they may have just guessed at the sense. They may
not have translated literally, but have given a rough paraphrase of what was said.
They may be literal at one place but paraphrastic at another; and in some ver-
sions, like the LXX, the translating techniques differed from book to book, and
even between sections of books.6

Because  evidence  for  the  Old  Testament  text  comes  from  many  different
sources and languages, the weight of the manuscript evidence must be care-
fully evaluated. This evaluation is based on ﬁve factors: language of the wit-
ness, date of the witness, reliability of the witness, provenance (origin/source)
and purpose of the witness, and interdependence of the witnesses. 

5.3.2.1 Language of the witness. Old Testament text critics are becoming much
more sophisticated in their evaluation of the ancient versions. They carefully ex-
amine each version to determine the standard deviation of an author in word us-
age  (i.e.,  comparing  how  consistently  an  author  translated  a  speciﬁc  Hebrew
word  into  another  language),  grammar  and  sentence  structure.  Through  this
type of in-depth comparison they can determine speciﬁc translation characteris-
tics and how close a given version is to its Vorlage (i.e., manuscript from which
the scribe was copying). Nevertheless, caution should be exercised here since the
translator may not have always followed or even understood the Vorlage. Thus
we must still consider texts written in Hebrew to be of primary importance.

5.3.2.2 Date of the witness. The general principle to follow is that the more
times a text has been copied, the greater the possibility for corruption. Excep-
tions to this principle are based on the skill of the copyists in preserving their
Vorlage or the method of the copyist. For example, the copyist of 1QIsaa appar-
ently was not merely interested in copying the Hebrew text but added matres
lectionis and other changes to render the text more understandable to his read-
ers. Because of this, as Tov has noted, the text of 1QIsaa differs more from the
MT than do some of the later medieval manuscripts.7 Despite this, however, it
is noteworthy that the vast majority of changes are in orthography (i.e., how
the words are spelled) and do not affect the meaning of the text. 

Because the text of the proto-MT became highly uniﬁed during the ﬁrst cen-
tury  A.D.,  texts  before  this  date  may  contain  variant  readings  that  were  re-
moved during this time period. Some of these early traditions, such as the LXX
and Dead Sea Scrolls, may provide important evidence concerning the original
reading of the text. This is one reason why the Dead Sea Scrolls, most of which
date from before the ﬁrst century A.D., are important to textual criticism.

5.3.2.3 Reliability of the witness. Reliability of a manuscript is based on how
close a text remains to its textual tradition (most scholars consider the MT the
most reliable textual tradition overall to date). Since the discovery of the Dead
Sea  Scrolls,  scholars  have  recognized  that  some  of  these  texts  are  virtually
identical to the MT and thus that the accuracy of this tradition was maintained
for well over one thousand years. Still this does not mean that the MT has the
best readings in every passage. Even the Codex Leningradensis, the earliest,
most complete Hebrew manuscript we have of the MT, appears to have accu-
;  [te6kalenna=]  instead  of
mulated  errors  in  its  text  (e.g.,  Genesis  6:16:  hn%

5.3.2.4 Provenance (origin/source) and purpose of the text. When weighing evi-
dence, it is important to understand the background of a manuscript and why
it was written. For example, the SP was either written or emended to conﬁrm
doctrines sacred to the Samaritans (e.g., Deuteronomy 12:5 of the SP identiﬁes
“the place which the Lord your God shall choose” as Gerizim instead of Jeru-
salem, as the MT suggests in later passages).

5.3.2.5 Interdependence of the witnesses.  Some witnesses are interdependent
and should be considered as just one witness when they agree. This principle
comes into play with the LXX and the following versions that are in some way
dependent on it: Peshitta (later intrusions of LXX readings), Old Latin, Vulgate,
Sahidic, Bohairic, Ethiopic, Armenian and Arabic. It is still important to con-
sult these versions since a witness may be dependent on the LXX in general and
yet be at variance in speciﬁc readings. When these versions disagree with the
LXX, they may reﬂect an original, independent reading.8

5.3.3 Quality of the Sources

According to these ﬁve criteria, the list of witnesses have roughly the order of
importance relative to Old Testament textual criticism as shown in table 5.4.9
Complete or nearly complete critical editions are now available for the chief
non-Hebrew versions: LXX, Peshitta, Targums and Vulgate. The critical edition
10 is a fairly reliable source for information regarding daughter trans-
of the LXX
lations, such as Old Latin, Coptic, Ethiopic and Syro-Hexapla, as well as cita-
tions of the LXX by early Jewish and Christian writers.

A three-step evaluation of the various textual witnesses will enable one to

narrow down the number of readings to consider.

1. Note any divergences from the MT in the following Hebrew manuscripts:

• Ancient Hebrew manuscripts, such as Qumran manuscripts, Silver Amulets,
Nash Papyrus and in manuscripts from Masada, Murabba(at, Cairo Genizah.

• Later Hebrew manuscripts, such as BHS (Leningradensis B19A), the Aleppo
Codex, Codex Cairensis, Daniel Bomberg Bible (the ﬁrst Rabbinic Bible).

2. Compare the LXX and its daughter translations and note any divergent
readings in the following (the Göttingen edition of the LXX often supplies the
majority of this information): Old Latin, Coptic (Sahidic and Bohairic), Ethi-
opic, Syro-Hexapla, Armenian. At some point it will be necessary to translate
the Hebrew text that gave rise to them. Because of the ambiguity and lack of
precision of this procedure, various options in translation should always be
noted. The concordance of the LXX by Edwin Hatch and Henry A. Redpath and
the index to Hatch and Redpath compiled by Elmar C. dos Santos will be help-
ful for translating the Greek of the LXX back into Hebrew. The latter work indi-
cates which Greek words have been used to translate speciﬁc Hebrew words
in the MT.11

3. Compare the other non-Greek translations to the MT, noting any diver-
gent readings: Vulgate, Peshitta, Targums, Arabic. Once again, it will be neces-
sary to translate the various languages back into Hebrew.

Example. A  corruption  that  is  not  resolved  merely  by  comparing  all  the
sources of the MT, but requires examination of both internal and external evi-
dence is found in Psalm 145:12-15:

Psalm 145 is an alphabetic acrostic, which means that each successive line
begins with the next letter of the Hebrew alphabet; however there is no nu=n
verse  in  the  MT.  It  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  the  author  would  have  in-
cluded  the  entire  Hebrew  alphabet;  the  context  suggests  therefore  that
something is missing. External evidence also points to an omission since a
Dead Sea Scroll manuscript, the LXX (pisto\v ku/riov e)n toi=v lo/goiv au)tou=,
kai\ o3siov e)n pa=si toi=v e!rgoiv au)tou=, “the Lord is faithful in his words, and
holy in all his works”) and the Syriac Peshitta each include the following
line  in  this  place:  “The  Lord  is  faithful  in  his  words  and  loving  in  all  his
deeds.” The verse, when translated back into Hebrew, can be constructed to
begin with a nu=n:

5.4 Determining the Most Plausible Original Reading

Once the evidence has been collected and evaluated, the next step is to deter-
mine the most plausible reading of the ﬁnal form of the text. Inherent in the
process  is  one  of  the  most  important  principles  in  textual  criticism:  Which
reading would most likely give rise to the others? The following steps are gen-
erally necessary to determine the most plausible reading. The three-step eval-
uation  process  on  pages  121-25  can  be  used  to  organize  the  evidence  when
weighing a reading. 

5.4.1 Consider the Strength of the Textual Tradition 

First, one must determine which form of the MT is most reliable (step one de-
scribed  above).  Most  variants  are  minor  and  can  be  resolved  by  examining
how similar forms of words or grammatical constructions are used in other
parts of the book or in similar genres of the Old Testament. Pay close attention
to discovering how the variations could have arisen and which reading could
have given rise to the others. If at the end of this evaluation it is still unclear
which reading of the MT is the most reliable, then leave open the possibilities
until more evidence is available.

5.4.2 Examine Internal Evidence

Now examine the context, grammar, structure and anything else in the pas-
sage that may help determine the most plausible reading. Look for common
transmissional mistakes (i.e., haplography, dittography, etc.), similar spellings,
similar grammatical structures and other things that may provide evidence. 

5.4.3 Examine External Evidence

Now expand your examination to include all the external evidence mentioned
above. The aim of this part of your evaluation will be to determine which read-
ing has the strongest evidence. At this point keep in mind that manuscripts
must be weighed, not merely counted. Special care must be taken to determine
interdependence  between  sources  so  that  a  particular  reading  is  not  given
more weight than it deserves. 

5.4.4 Evaluate the Evidence

Use the principles mentioned earlier to determine which reading is preferred
for the original reading of the text. 

• Determine the reading that would most likely give rise to the other read-

ings.

• Carefully evaluate the weight of the manuscript evidence.

• Determine if the reading is a secondary reading or a gloss.

• Determine which reading is most appropriate in its context.

At times these rules may conﬂict with one another. For example, a second-
ary reading may also be the most appropriate reading in context. This is where
the skill of the Old Testament text critic comes
into play—one must carefully evaluate all the
evidence.  This  evaluation  process  is  some-
times  difﬁcult  because  some  of  the  evidence
may  be  missing.  The  two  most  important
guidelines,  however,  are  trying  to  determine
(1) the reading that would most likely give rise
to the other readings is preferable, and (2) the
reading that is most appropriate in context is
preferable. Common sense, caution and logic
must prevail—sometimes several readings are possible. In general the MT of-
ten contains the most reliable reading even though in some instances its read-
ings can apparently be improved. It is also possible that the vocalization of the
MT may not be as accurate as the consonantal text since vowel points were not
added to the text until the ﬁfth to ninth centuries A.D. Prior to this, vocalization
was passed on orally from generation to generation, yet with apparent accu-
racy in most passages. However, there are times when the vocalization can sig-
niﬁcantly modify the meaning of the passage and must be taken into account
in the weighing process (e.g., in Jer 9:21 rbd can be vocalized as rb@
I, “speak,”
F, “a word”). The chart found at table 5.5 can be used to
rbed@
compile and weigh the evidence.

The  overall  thought  of  the  passage  will  not  usually  change  signiﬁcantly  no
matter which variant is chosen. When the difference is signiﬁcant, use caution and
leave open the options. Tov stresses that all variant readings have some value:

In practical terms, the conclusion of the evaluating procedure is that some read-
ings are often designated as “original” or “better” than others. It should, how-
ever, be remembered that when a reading is described by scholars as original, this
does not imply that the other readings are worthless. First, it is possible that the
assumption concerning the originality of the reading is incorrect, and that one of
the other readings should nevertheless be considered the better one. Second, all
ancient readings are valuable, since they contain important information, not only
concerning the textual transmission, but also about the exegetical considerations
of the early scribes and the ﬁrst generations of those who read and interpreted
the Bible, particularly their linguistic and intellectual milieu.12

5.4.5 Possible Emendations 

Only after every other avenue of evidence has been exhausted should the text
critic resort to emending the text, and even then the emendation should re-
main tentative. An emendation is “an attempt to reconstruct an original read-
ing that has not survived among extant manuscripts.”13
 McCarter explains the
difﬁculty of proposing an emendation:

Because emendation is, at least in part, a matter of intuition, it is not possible to
establish  a  set  of  rules  that  govern  it.  Perhaps  the  chief  necessity  is  that  the
scholar should be self-critical in emending the text. A reading arising from emen-
dation  is  subject  to  the  same  evaluative  criteria  as  a  transmitted  reading.  The
critic must apply these to anything he proposes and pass judgment on it accord-
ingly. Does the proposed emendation explain all the transmitted readings? Is it
suited to its context?14

5.5 Speciﬁc Examples

5.5.1 1 Chronicles 6:40 (MT 25). The marginal note in the NIV for 1 Chronicles 6:40
a, ba(a6s8e4ya=); it says that
(MT 25) indicates a variant of the name Baaseiah (hyF#&

'(jma (ma(a6s8e4ya= ).

The works of Kennicott, de Rossi and Ginsburg15 reveal that the vast major-

ity  of  Hebrew  manuscripts  read  “Baaseiah”  (hyF#&
would thus appear to be the favored textual tradition. The next step is to dis-
cover  whether  any  other  evidence  would  help  determine  which  reading  is
most reliable.

Consider the internal and external evidence.

• Internal evidence. Is there any evidence of transmissional corruption? Do any
parallel  passages  favor  one  of  the  readings?  The  name  as  it  appears  in
1 Chronicles 6:40 is a hapax legomenon (i.e., occurs only here), and there are no
parallel passages. A transmissional corruption is likely since in some Dead
Sea Scrolls texts the b (be=t) and m (me=m) are similar, but it is still difﬁcult to

know which is the preferred reading of this name.

'(jb@

• External evidence. The only signiﬁcant evidence from the versions is that Co-
dex Vaticanus (a fourth-century A.D. Greek manuscript), Lucian’s (d. A.D.
312)  Greek  recension  and  the  Peshitta  (probably  about  the  third  century
'(jma [ma(a=s8e4ya=]); the rest support “Baaseiah”
A.D.) support “Maaseiah” (hyF#&
a [ba(a6s8e4ya=]). Based on evidence found in these early Greek and Syr-
(hyF#&
iac manuscripts, the editors of BHS suggest that the text should be changed
'(jma [ma(a6s8e4ya=]). It is difﬁcult to know if the Syriac
to read “Maaseiah” (hyF#&
Peshitta is inﬂuenced by later intrusions from the Septuagint. In the books
of  Chronicles,  but  since  the  MT  tradition  and  many  of  the  Greek  manu-
scripts are fairly consistent in reading “Baaseiah,” I believe that the reading
hyF#&

a (ba(a6s8e4ya=) should probably be retained.

5.5.2 Hosea 7:14

An interesting textual variant is recorded in the NIV of Hosea 7:14: 

They do not cry out to me from their hearts (but) wail upon their beds. They gather
together for grain and new wine but turn away from me. 

The textual note in the BHS reads:

14 c l c nonn Mss Ö (katete/mnonto) wddwgty ut 1 R 18,28 // 

The  note  means  “read  with  some  Hebrew  manuscripts  (nonn  Mss)  and
the  LXX  (katete/mnonto)  all  of  which  suggest  that  the  text  should  be  read  as
w@ddfwOg%t;yI (yitgo=da4du=, “they slash themselves”) as in 1 Kings 18:28.”

Most Hebrew manuscripts read “they gather together,” and a careful exam-
ination of Kennicott, de Rossi and Ginsburg reveals that the MT fairly consis-
tently reads the verb w@rrFwOg%t;yI (yitgo=ra4ru=, “they gather together”) in this verse.
However,  some  Hebrew  manuscripts  (11-20)  and  the  LXX  (katete/mnonto
[katetemnonto,  “they  cut  themselves”])  suggest  that  the  reading  should  be
w@ddFwOg%t;yI (yitgo=da4du=, “they slash themselves”).

• Internal evidence. The context is not very helpful in determining the more
plausible  reading  since  both  are  feasible.  The  reading  “they  gather  to-
gether” is compatible with the context since the Israelites were calling on
God, though their hearts did not seem to be in it. The reading “they slash
themselves” is also reasonable since during the eighth century B.C. many Is-
raelites followed Baal and, according to 1 Kings 18:28, the prophets of Baal
cut themselves as part of appeasement rituals. The structure of the verse
may be of help here, for it is divided into two main parts:

And they did not cry out to me from their hearts
when they wailed upon their beds.

2005 Students Guide.book  Page 137  Thursday, June 17, 2010  3:07 PM

Determining the Most Plausible Original Reading

137

They slashed themselves (or gather together) concerning the grain and new wine;
they turned against me.

If this is indeed the structure of the verse, then the ﬁrst part describes Is-
rael’s heartless worship and the second part their turning against God. In
this structure the reading “they slashed themselves” makes more sense, de-
scribing how the people had turned against God, whereas the phrase “they
gather  together”  would  seemingly  require  an  explanatory  phrase  to  de-
scribe what the Israelites were doing wrong (e.g., “they were gathering to-
gether with a wrong heart attitude”).

• External  evidence.  The  LXX  clearly  favors  the  reading  “they  slash  them-

selves,” though evidence from other versions varies greatly.

It is hard to believe that the Israelites would actually stoop so low to ap-
pease Baal, which may be one reason the variant entered the text. In addition
the  letters  d  (da4let)  and  r  (re4s\)  are  quite  similar  in  both  paleo-Hebrew  and
square script, so a scribe could have easily confused them at some point in the
copying process. However, it does seem reasonable based on the internal and
external evidence that “to slash themselves” is the more likely reading.

Getting to Know the Sources 
of Old Testament Textual Criticism

This chapter introduces the reader to the key source materials and their relevance
to Old Testament textual criticism. It includes primary sources such as the Silver
Amulets, Dead Sea Scrolls and Nash Papyrus, and also secondary sources such
as the SP, Targums, and LXX.

They still say that the best way to spot counterfeit money is to become very fa-
miliar  with  the  real  thing.1  This  is  also  true  of  Old  Testament  textual  criti-
cism—the better we know the sources, the better we will understand their pur-
pose,  possible  corruptions,  relationship  to  one  another  and  value  for  Old
Testament textual criticism. Waltke states correctly: “No one source perfectly
preserves the original text of the Old Testament, and in case of disagreement
the critic must decide on the original reading in light of all the sources and his
knowledge about them.”2 The Old Testament text critic must have a thorough
knowledge of these sources in order to evaluate them properly. This chapter
provides  a  brief  summary  of  the  most  important  primary  and  secondary
sources,  surveying  the  major  texts  in  chronological  order,  with  mention  of
their relevance to Old Testament textual criticism.

ver amulets, dated to the mid-seventh century B.C.3 Part of the priestly benedic-
tion of Numbers 6:22-27 was written on two small silver sheets (when unrolled
the larger is about 1 inch wide by 4 inches long and the smaller is about 1/2 inch
wide by 1-1/2 inches long [see ﬁg. 6.1]). The Silver Amulets were written in pa-
leo-Hebrew script and have no vowel pointings or word divisions. This text is
important because of its age and the close similarity of the larger amulet to the
MT of Numbers 6:22-27. The differences between the larger amulet and the MT
are (1) one less k (ka4p) in line 5, so that it reads “the LORD bless” instead of “the
LORD  bless  you,”  and  (2)  in  lines  9-10  the  words  K1yle)'  wynfp%

you and keep you and make his face shine upon you and give to you peace,”
which may have summarized the text of the MT.

6.1.2 Dead Sea Scrolls

It is hard to believe that an Arab shepherd boy could forever change the study
of Old Testament textual criticism, but in 1947 his chance discovery of several
of the Dead Sea Scrolls had that effect.4 Until then the oldest, most complete
Hebrew manuscript of the Old Testament was the text of Codex Leningraden-
sis Ms. B19A, dated to A.D. 1008. The Dead Sea Scrolls provided texts of the Old
Testament from approximately one thousand years earlier (dated from about
250 B.C. to A.D. 100). To this point eleven caves have been discovered surround-
ing Qumran (about seven miles south of Jericho; see map 6.1) in which manu-
scripts or fragments have been found of all the biblical books (usually several
copies) except Esther and possibly Nehemiah. It is possible that Ezra and Ne-
hemiah were combined into one book as in the Hebrew canon and thus only
Esther is without attestation. There are 202 biblical manuscripts or fragments
of the biblical books, and they are primarily written in square script; however,
there are twelve fragments of biblical scrolls written in paleo-Hebrew (three of
Genesis, one of Exodus, four of Leviticus, one of Numbers, two of Deuteron-
omy and one of Job).5 The most common manuscripts of biblical books found
at  Qumran  come  from  the  Psalms  (thirty-nine  mss),  Deuteronomy  (twenty-
seven mss) and Isaiah (twenty-one mss).

4Information regarding the discovery of the scrolls can be found in John M. Allegro, The Dead
Sea Scrolls (Harmondsworth, Middlesex: Penguin, 1957), pp. 15-34; Frank M. Cross, The An-
cient Library of Qumran and Biblical Studies, 2nd ed. (1961; reprint, Grand Rapids: Baker, 1980),

of  mss; 

Because  these  biblical  manu-
scripts  were  written  at  different
times and places, they differ in tex-
tual,  linguistic  and  scribal  charac-
teristics.  There  is  textual  diversity
among  the  Qumran  manuscripts,
which are dated from the third cen-
tury  B.C.  to  the  ﬁrst  century  A.D.;
the  largest  percentage  of  the  texts
closely  follow  the  readings  of  the
proto-MT (35 percent of mss). Oth-
ers  demonstrate  some  characteris-
tics of a pre-Samaritan text (15 per-
4QpaleoExodm,
cent 
4QNumb,  4QDeutn,  4Q158)  or  of  a
proto-LXX  text  (5  percent  of  mss;
4QExodb,  4QLevd,  4QJerb,  4QJerd).
However, no manuscript is identi-
cal  or  nearly  identical  to  the  He-
brew  text  that  gave  rise  to  these
translations.6 Tov argues that there
are  two  more  textual  groups  in
Qumran manuscripts: (1) texts fol-
lowing the Qumran practice of taking a free approach to the biblical text and
resulting in unusual forms, frequent errors and numerous corrections (about
20 percent of mss),7 and (2) nonaligned texts that are not signiﬁcantly close to
any other textual groups and seem to agree and disagree with them equally as
many  times  (35  percent  of  mss;  2QExoda,b,  4QExod-Levf,  11QpaleoLeva,
4QDeutb,c,h,k1,k2,m, 5QDeut, etc). While textual diversity is quite obvious among
the texts from Qumran, the great number of proto-MT manuscripts almost cer-
tainly reﬂects its authoritative status.8 

Map 6.1. The Dead Sea and surrounding area

The Dead Sea Scrolls are crucial to Old Testament textual criticism for sev-

eral reasons:

• They were written during a transitional stage between unpointed texts and
pointed texts; matres lectionis were used to indicate some of the important
vowels  (full  vowel  pointing  was  not  added  until  several  hundred  years
later; see p. 35).

• They  contain  evidence  as  to  how  the  biblical  texts  were  read  before  the

proto-MT became uniﬁed by the ﬁrst century A.D.

• Some copies of the biblical texts also indicate how they were interpreted by
this community (generally a pesher method of interpretation was employed,
applying biblical texts directly to the contemporary situation). 

• Information regarding the copying and correcting process of manuscripts
can be gleaned from them, including (1) consonants that were mistakenly
interchanged, (2) questionable letters that either were crossed out or around
which dots were placed, (3) corrections written in the margins that could
have  confused  later  copyists,  and  (4)  the  addition  of  diacritical  marks
(marks indicating insertions, deletions or some other textual note).9

To get a better feel for the Dead Sea Scrolls, we will look at ﬁve signiﬁcant

biblical texts from the Scrolls.

6.1.2.1 The First Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaa). The 1QIsaa scroll contains the entire
book  of  Isaiah.10  There  are  about  1,375  different  readings  and  4,500  ortho-
graphic variants (variations in the way words are spelled) between this Isaiah
Scroll (see ﬁg. 6.2) and the MT; the latter make no difference in the reading of
the text and the former alter it only slightly.11

[John C. Trever]

Sea Scrolls, 2 vols. (Louvain: Publications universitaires, 1958).

6.1.2.2 The Second Isaiah Scroll (1QIsab). The 1QIsab scroll is much closer to the
MT than 1QIsaa, but it is in very poor condition; only the upper part of the last
third of the scroll and a few fragments from the middle have been preserved.12
The text contains fewer plene spellings than 1QIsaa.

6.1.2.3 The Habakkuk Commentary (1QpHab). The 1QpHab scroll is a transla-
tion of and commentary on the ﬁrst two chapters of Habakkuk (see ﬁg. 6.3).13
The sacred name Yahweh (hwhy, yhwh) is written in paleo-Hebrew script in this
manuscript.

Figure 6.3. A section of a page from the Habbakkuk commentary with Yahweh’s name in
paleo-Hebrew [John C. Trever]

6.1.2.4 The Psalms Scroll (11QPsa). The 11QPsa scroll is in very good condition
at the top, but the bottom is in an advanced state of decomposition.14 It con-
tains forty-one canonical psalms from the last third of the psalter (though not
in canonical order), seven apocryphal psalms, Psalm 151 (which is recorded in
the  LXX) and a psalm from Sirach 51:13-20. The name Yahweh (hwhy) is also
written in paleo-Hebrew script.

According to James C. VanderKam, approximately 25 percent (202 out of
about 800) of the manuscripts found at Qumran are biblical texts.15 This still
leaves  numerous  other  works,  such  as  apocryphal  books  (four),  pseude-

pigraphal works (three previously known and about ﬁfty new), commentaries
on biblical books (about 23), sectarian documents (some of the most important
are  the  Damascus  Document,  Manual  of  Discipline,  Temple  Scroll,  some  of  the
Works of the Torah [4QMMT]) and eschatological works (The War Scroll, texts
about the future New Jerusalem).

The  Hebrew  script  of  the  Dead  Sea  Scrolls  is  similar  to  modern  square
script, making it fairly easy to compare them to the MT. The increase in matres
lectionis is generally an insigniﬁcant variation, though the orthography (spell-
ing)  may  help  determine  the  date  of  the  passage.  For  textual  criticism  one
should note deviations of the scrolls from the MT—sometimes they will follow
readings found in the LXX and SP.

6.1.3 Nash Papyrus

The Nash Papyrus (see ﬁg. 6.4) is a damaged copy of the Decalogue (Ten Com-
mandments).  William  F.  Albright  used  paleographic  evidence  to  date  this
work to the Maccabean period (169-37 B.C.). Paul Kahle dated it according to
internal  evidence  to  before  the  Roman  destruction  of  the  Jerusalem  temple
(A.D. 70).16 It contains Exodus 20:2-17 (see also the parallel passage of Deuter-
onomy  5:6-21,  from  which  some  of  the  variants  may  derive)  and  the Shema
(“Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God is one God”) from Deuteronomy 6:4-5. This
combination of texts suggests that it was not part of a biblical scroll but rather
a collection of texts used for another purpose. It is interesting that the sixth and
seventh  commandments  are  reversed  and  that  the  Shema  is  preceded  by  a
phrase conﬁrmed only by the LXX: 

hwc r#) My+p#mhw My[qxh hl)w]
Myrcm Cr)m Mt)cb rbdmb [l)r#y ynb] t) h#m
[w)lh hh[q]ym whms\pt@ym )s\r s@wh ms\h )t [bny ys8r)l] bmdbr bs@)tm m)rs@ ms@rym

“These are the ordinances and the judgments that Moses commanded the sons of
Israel in the wilderness when they went forth from the land of Egypt.” 

This reading suggests that the text of the Nash Papyrus is related to or at

least inﬂuenced by the LXX.

The Nash Papyrus is written in Hebrew square script (very similar to the
Qumran  script)  and  corresponds  closely  to  the  text  of  the  MT.  It  has  more
matres lectionis than the MT. (These can help us date the text, though they do
not change its meaning.) It has a few minor differences from the MT that also
appear in the LXX and Vulgate.17 Since there is a strong similarity between the
Nash Papyrus and the LXX, it is plausible that the LXX translators followed a
similar text or that the text represented in the Nash Papyrus (which appears to
be later than the LXX) was modiﬁed to correspond to the LXX.

16William F. Albright, “A Biblical Fragment from the Maccabaean Age: The Nash Papyrus,”
JBL 56 (1937): 145-76; Paul Kahle, Die hebräischen Handschriften aus der Höhle (Stuttgart: Kohl-
hammer, 1951), pp. 5-6.

17For example, line 10 lacks the b (b, “in”) of the word Mwybw (wbywm, “and in the day”), which

is found in the MT, but line 11 contains hb (bh, “in it”) which is not found there.

In 1951 Bedouin from the

a piece of a leather sandal
and  a  scroll  fragment  in
one  of  four  caves  located
in  Wadi  Murabba(at  (or

Qumran  (see  map  6.1).
Excavations began in Jan-

ity  of  documents  come
from Cave 2.

Several  small  fragments  dated  to  the  Roman  period  and  containing  text
written in Herodian script from the books of Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Deu-
teronomy, Isaiah and the Minor Prophets were discovered, and the oldest pa-
pyrus document ever found in Israel. The latter is a palimpsest (a manuscript
whose earlier writing was scraped off in order to be reused), the earlier writing
of which is too faint to decipher fully but is dated by paleography to the eighth
or seventh century B.C. Its later text, which contains a list of names with sym-
bols and ﬁgures, is dated to the sixth century B.C. The most complete text is a
scroll with ten of the twelve Minor Prophets (Mur 88; see ﬁg. 6.6) written in He-
brew square script and dated to the second century A.D. All the manuscripts

6.1.5 Manuscripts at Masada

Masada (which means “stronghold” or “mountain fortress” in Hebrew) is a
large plateau located about two-thirds of the way down the western shore of
the Dead Sea (see map 6.1). This site is a natural fortiﬁcation since its sides are
sheer cliffs of up to 1,300 feet in some places.

Figure 6.7. A photograph of Masada with an inset of the palace on the northern end of the
plateau [Courtesy of Galilee College]

The Hasmoneans apparently were the ﬁrst to occupy this mountain fortress,
but Herod the Great (40 B.C.-A.D. 4) did most of the major construction here, in-
cluding a beautiful three-tiered palace on its northern edge, from approximately
36-30 B.C. (see ﬁg. 6.7). Later, during the First Jewish Revolt (A.D. 66-73), a group
of zealots captured Masada and held it until A.D. 73, three years after the fall of
Jerusalem. The Jewish zealots employed guerrilla warfare tactics to harass Ro-
man troops and then ﬂed to Masada for protection. In A.D. 72 Flavius Silva led
the tenth legion against the zealots at Masada. He forced Jewish prisoners to
build a ramp up the side of the fortress (which can still be seen in the picture),
because he knew that the zealots would not kill their own countrymen. The Ro-
man army breached the fortiﬁcation in April A.D. 73, and Silva planned the ﬁnal
attack on Masada the following day. During the night, however, about nine hun-
dred zealots committed suicide rather than surrender to the Romans. 

Excavations  at  Masada  in  1963-1965  uncovered  the  remains  of  fourteen
scrolls, including biblical, sectarian and apocryphal texts. They date to some-
time before A.D. 73, when the Romans stormed the fortress, and provide fur-
ther evidence that the Hebrew text had become uniﬁed by the ﬁrst century A.D.
Some of the more interesting biblical texts are:

• A very fragmentary Psalms scroll containing parts of Psalms 81:3 (ET 81:2)
to 85:10 (ET 85:9) (see ﬁg. 6.8). The text of this scroll is identical to the MT in
both content and spelling.

Figure 6.8. A fragment of Psalm 82 from Masada [Israel Antiquities Authority]

• A fragment of Leviticus containing the second half of eight lines from Levi-

ticus 4:3-9. It is identical to the MT in content and spelling.

• A fragmentary Leviticus scroll containing Leviticus 8—12. The text of this
document is identical to the MT even in respect to the traditional divisions
of  the  “open”  (where  the  line  is  left  open  after  a  Hebrew  sentence)  and
“closed” (where another Hebrew sentence ﬁnishes up the line) sections.

• A scroll of Ezekiel and one containing the ﬁnal two chapters of Deuteron-
omy. These texts largely reﬂect the traditional MT, but a few readings in the
Ezekiel scroll differ slightly from the MT.20

• A copy of Psalm 150, seemingly at the end of a manuscript, which suggests
that the Psalms at Masada may have been ordered similarly to the canonical
psalter. 

The Masada manuscripts are written in Hebrew square script and are vir-
tually identical to the MT (in wording as well as the divisions of the lines), ex-
cept for slight differences in the Ezekiel text.

texts, along with a Hebrew phylactery fragment of Exodus 13:2-10, 11-16, are
dated to about A.D. 130 and their translations are virtually identical to the MT.

6.1.7 Cairo Genizah Manuscripts

The Cairo Genizah is a storage room found in the 1860s in the Ben-Ezra syna-
gogue, which was built in A.D. 1015 in Fostat or Old Cairo.22 A genizah (from the
:, ge6naz, “to hide”) was a room used to store manuscripts until
Aramaic word znag%
they could be properly disposed of so that they would not be misused or pro-
faned since they contained the name of God. Apparently the genizah was for-
gotten  and  it  was  walled  over  and  undisturbed  until  the  1860s.  This  hidden
storeroom  contained  a  great  variety  of  materials;  it  has  been  estimated  that
about 200,000 fragments were deposited there (see ﬁg. 6.10).23 The vast majority
come  from  about  A.D.  1000  to  1400,  though  some  date  much  earlier  (sixth  to

eighth centuries). Several dozen manuscripts are palimpsests, about ﬁfteen per-
cent of which are biblical texts in Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic. The genizah also
housed materials from the Midrash, Mishnah, Talmud, liturgical texts, lists, let-
ters and much more. Some of the most important items discovered were:

• An  almost  complete  copy  of  the  Wisdom  of  Jesus  ben  Sirach  in  Hebrew
(previous to this discovery the work was known only from Greek texts).

• The Zadokite Document (a work closely related to the Manual of Discipline
[1QS] from Qumran and is now generally known as the Damascus Document
[CD = Cairo Genizah Document]).

• The most important documents for the study of textual criticism are the
biblical  manuscripts,  some  of  which  date  back  to  the  sixth  century  A.D.
These show how more and more vowel pointings were gradually added
in  the  Tiberian  pointing  system.24  At  present  the  earliest  completely

24The Palestinian pointing system had been virtually lost until the discovery of several manu-
scripts from the Cairo Genizah with this pointing (see Oxford Ms. Heb e 30, fol. 48b). Other
manuscripts show varying degrees of pointing, suggesting that there were several stages in
the development of the pointing system.

6.1.8.1 Ben Asher manuscripts. From the second half of the eighth century A.D.
to the mid-tenth century A.D., the Ben Asher family played a leading role in re-
cording and maintaining the MT at Tiberias.26 The following are the earliest Ben
Asher manuscripts, providing important examples of this tradition.

• Codex  Cairensis.27  (This  manuscript  contains  only  the  Former  and  Latter
Prophets.) This well-preserved document appears to have been written and
pointed by Moses ben Asher in A.D. 895. It has several colophons (a note at
the  end  of  a  manuscript  that  provides  information  about  the  scribe  and
other matters). Kahle mentions that there are many corrections, perhaps in
an effort to make it correspond to other Ben Asher manuscripts.28

• Aleppo Codex.29 One quarter of this manuscript, dated to the ﬁrst half of the
tenth  century,  was  destroyed  by  ﬁre  (Genesis  1:1—Deuteronomy  28:16;
Song of Solomon 3:11 to the end of the Old Testament, including Ecclesi-
astes,  Lamentations,  Esther,  Daniel  and  Ezra).  Its  colophon  states  that
Aaron ben Moses ben Asher copied the pointing and the Masorah about
A.D.  930  and  that  the  consonantal  text  can  be  attributed  to  Shelomo  ben
Buya(a. This codex predates the Codex Leningradensis by over ﬁfty years,
but they are very similar. During the Crusades (July 15, 1099) it was taken
as booty; about seven years later it was returned to the Karaites (a Jewish
sect originating in the eighth century that denied talmudic-rabbinical tradi-
tion), who then brought it to Cairo. It is now in Jerusalem and is being used
by the Hebrew University as the basis for another critical edition of the Old
Testament text.

• Oriental 4445.30 This manuscript contains 186 folios (i.e., a folded sheet of
paper yielding two book pages) of the Pentateuch: Genesis 39:20—Deuter-
onomy  1:33.  One  hundred  thirty-one  folios  are  an  early  form  of  the  Ben
Asher text dated to about 950 and the other 55 were added by a later hand
in about 1540.31 They are written in very large, bold handwriting with full
Palestinian  or  Western  vowel  points  and  accents  but  no  verse  dividers
(called so=p pasu=q, [.]) at the end of sentences. The Masorahs, both magna
and parva, were added in the margins later than the original writing.

very important witness to the Ben Asher family and is dated to 1008 by a
colophon. Another colophon states: “Samuel ben Jacob wrote and pointed
and provided with Masorah this codex of the Holy Scriptures from the cor-
rected and annotated books prepared by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher the
teacher, may he rest in the Garden of Eden! It has been corrected and prop-
erly annotated.”33 This manuscript was the main source for the most recent
critical Hebrew texts (BHK and BHS), being the oldest and most complete
manuscript accessible at the time (the Aleppo Codex was inaccessible and
lacks one-fourth of the Old Testament).

6.1.8.2  Leningrad  (Formerly  Petersburg)  Codex  of  the  Prophets.34  This  manu-
script, including only the Latter Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, the twelve
Minor Prophets) and the small and large Masorahs, is dated to 916. It is the
oldest dated text using the Babylonian supralinear system of vowel points and
accents, a system that had been lost for centuries. The codex was discovered
by Abraham Firkowitsch in 1839, apparently in the synagogue of Chufutkaleh
in Crimea. Würthwein describes its importance:

while using the Eastern signs the codex actually follows the Western tradition in
its consonantal text and its pointing. Thus it stands as an impressive symbol of
the victory of the Western tradition over the Eastern. . . . On several pages (212a,
221a) the Babylonian signs have been replaced by the Tiberian signs, and on folio
1b both systems stand side by side.35

6.1.8.3 Damascus Pentateuch.36 This codex contains most of the Pentateuch
(only Genesis 1:1—9:26 and Exodus 18:1-23a are missing) and is dated to the
late  ninth  or  early  tenth  century.  The  consonantal  text  is  from  the  Tiberian
school of Masoretes, with additional changes to help it conform better to the
MT (e.g., in Genesis 23:17 )rmm ynp l(,(l pny mmr), has been changed to the
MT’s )rmm ynpl, lpny mmr)). It was pointed according to the Ben Naphtali tra-
dition  (the  other  prominent  family  of  scribes  near  Tiberias),37  but  in  some
places the accents and vowel points have been scraped off and written over
with accents and vowel points from the Ben Asher tradition. All the margins
surrounding the text have Masoretic notes.

6.1.8.4 Codex Reuchlinianus of the Prophets.38 This manuscript is a recension

of the Ben Naphtali text, dated to about 1105.

6.1.8.5 Erfurtensis Codices.39 These three manuscripts now belong to the State
Library of Prussian Cultural Properties in Berlin. E1, dated to the fourteenth
century, contains the entire Old Testament, Targums and the small and large
Masorahs. E2 dates to the thirteenth century and contains the entire Old Tes-
tament, Targum Onkelos and the small and large Masorahs. E3 contains the
entire Old Testament, small and large Masorahs, extracts from Okhla weOkhla,
and is the earliest of these texts, dated before 1100.

6.1.9 Important Printed Hebrew Editions

• Soncino Bible. Published in 1488 by Rabbi Joshua in Soncino, Italy (a small
village in the vicinity of Milan). This is the ﬁrst complete, printed Hebrew
Bible. It includes vowel points and accents but there is no Masorah for the
text. It was produced in four separate parts by different people in order to
expedite  its  publication.  The  order  of  the  biblical  books  is  unusual—the
Megilloth (i.e., ﬁve scrolls, including Esther, Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lam-
entations and Ecclesiastes) directly follows the Pentateuch.

• Daniel Bomberg Bible.  Edited by Felix Pratensis, a Christian Jew (d. 1539),
and  published  (1516-1517)  by  Daniel  Bomberg  in  Venice.  This  is  the  ﬁrst
Rabbinic  Bible.  It  contains  the  Hebrew  text  along  with  the Aramaic  Tar-
gums (Onkelos, Jonathan ben Uzziel, Rabbi Joseph, Jerusalem Targum II,
the  second  Targum  on  Esther)  and  several  rabbinic  commentaries  (e.g.,
Rashi, Kimh[i). This is the ﬁrst printed edition of the Old Testament to divide
Samuel, Kings and Chronicles into two books each, Ezra into both Ezra and
Nehemiah, and to include some Qere readings in the margins. Felix Praten-
sis dedicated his work to Pope Leo X.

• Complutensian Polyglot Bible. Cardinal Ximenes, archbishop of Toledo, pro-
duced this polyglot (the biblical text appears in several different languages
arranged in parallel columns) in Alcala, Spain, by permission of Pope Leo
X.  The  Old  Testament  comprises  the  MT,  LXX  and  Vulgate  versions.  Prior
to this time the Hebrew Scriptures had been edited and printed exclusively

by Jews. Spain became a celebrated seat of Hebrew learning; the scribes at
Toledo had access to some of the oldest and most reliable manuscripts. Car-
dinal Ximenes was the ﬁrst Christian to furnish the church with a Hebrew
text of the Old Testament; unfortunately, authorization for publication did
not occur until 1520, after Ximenes’s death. The ﬁrst four volumes include
the Old Testament in the same order as the Vulgate; the last two volumes
contain the New Testament and a critical apparatus. The Hebrew text does
not include accents, and the vowel points are unreliable, but the consonan-
tal text is very accurate and is based in large measure on a critical examina-
tion of the manuscripts, a signiﬁcant ﬁrst step for textual criticism of the
Old Testament.

• Second Rabbinic Bible of  Jacob ben H9ayyim. Published in 1524/1525 by Daniel
Bomberg  in  Venice  and  edited  by  an  orthodox  rabbinic  Jew  from  Tunis
(Jacob ben H9ayyim). This four-volume work was the standard printed text of
the Old Testament until the twentieth century (see ﬁg. 6.12). It contains the
Hebrew text, an Aramaic Targum (in the Pentateuch: Targum Onkelos; in
the rest: Targum Jonathan), small, large and ﬁnal Masorahs, and comments
by  important  rabbis  (Rashi,  Ibn  Ezra,  Kimh[i,  etc.).  This  manuscript  was
thought  to  be  a  good  representation  of  the  Ben Asher  text,  but  it  is  now
viewed as a mixture of various traditions from manuscripts shortly before
the time it was written.

• Antwerp Polyglot. Published in 1569-1572 by Christophe Plantin at Antwerp
(Belgium)  and  paid  for  by  King  Philip  II  of  Spain  (thus  it  is  sometimes
called Biblia Regia). The ﬁrst four volumes comprise the Old Testament, in-
cluding  the  Hebrew  text,  the  ofﬁcial  Targums  (except  for  Daniel,  Ezra-
Nehemiah  and  Chronicles)  with  a  Latin  version,  the  LXX  (following  the
Complutensian text) with a Latin version, and the Vulgate. The Hebrew text
of the Antwerp Polyglot derives from the Complutensian Polyglot and the
Second Rabbinic Bible of Jacob ben H9ayyim.

• Paris Polyglot. The cost of this polyglot was underwritten by Guy M. leJay,
who from 1629 to 1645 employed two chief editors: J. Morinus edited the SP
and its Targum (following the manuscript of the SP brought to Europe in
1616 by Pietro de la Valle), and Gabriel Sionita edited the Peshitta text. This
too is a massive work, entailing ten volumes (vols. 1-4 reproduce the Old
Testament with the same versions as the Antwerp Polyglot; vols. 5-6 com-
prise the New Testament, and vols. 7-10 include the SP and its Targum, the
Peshitta, and an Arabic version along with a Latin translation).

• London  Polyglot  Bible.  Produced  from  1654  to  1657  by  Brian  Walton,  who
later became bishop of Chester, this remarkable six-volume work includes

and  an  Arabic,  all  with  their  Latin  translations  (see  ﬁg.  6.13).  The  text
mainly  followed  Jacob  ben  H9ayyim’s  text  (Second  Rabbinic  Bible)  and  Jo-
hann Buxtorf’s (Sixth Rabbinic Bible).

• Biblia Hebraica. Published in 1720 by Johann Heinrich Michaelis (1668-1738),
a prominent German pietist, as well as a Protestant theologian and oriental-
ist at Halle. This text largely follows Daniel E. Jablonski’s 1699 edition and
was the ﬁrst to include a textual apparatus of the most important readings
from  ﬁve  manuscripts  at  Erfurt,  Germany,  and  nineteen  other  printed
manuscripts.

• Vetus  Testamentum  Hebraicum  cum  variis  lectionibus.  Published  from  1776-
1780 by Benjamin Kennicott (1718-1783), canon of Christ Church, Oxford.
This  two-volume  Hebrew  text,  with  its  massive  textual  apparatus,  was
printed without vowel points or accents and compiled variants from 615
manuscripts, 52 editions of the Hebrew text, and 16 manuscripts of the SP.
Kennicott spent about ten years compiling readings of manuscripts from
England, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and other countries.

B. de Rossi, an Italian scholar. This work is not a Hebrew text but rather a
collection of variants of the consonantal text of the Old Testament. It con-
tains readings from 1,475 manuscripts and editions, and is more thorough
than any of its predecessors (see ﬁg. 6.14).

6.2 Secondary Sources (Non-Hebrew Texts)

Within the last ﬁfty years Old Testament textual criticism has experienced rev-
olutionary changes. One of the most important is that we now have Hebrew
manuscripts dated to the third or early second century B.C. Previous to this the
oldest  extant  Hebrew  manuscripts  were  from  the  ninth  and  tenth  centuries
A.D. Secondary sources (e.g., Greek translations, targums, other versions) that
predated these were used extensively for Old Testament textual criticism. Tov
describes this situation:

Until recently, Old Testament textual criticism has paid much attention to the ver-
sions.  This  interest  was  justiﬁed  because  the  oldest  Hebrew  manuscripts  were
from  the  Middle  Ages,  whereas  some  of  the  manuscripts  of  the  Septuagint,
Peshitta, and Vulgate are from the fourth and ﬁfth centuries. This situation has
now changed because the Hebrew scrolls from the Judean desert [Qumran] . . .
are not only considerably older than the oldest manuscripts of the versions but
also substantively more important. It is therefore likely that in the coming dec-
ades the text-critical interest will be focused more on Hebrew sources than on the
versions, even though text-critically the latter remain of great importance, espe-
cially the Septuagint.40

There  are  three  important  concepts  to  remember  when  dealing  with  sec-
ondary sources. First, the process of translating a text from one language to an-
other  involves  a  distinct  set  of  problems,  such  as  the  difﬁculties  of  ﬁnding
equivalent words to translate the original language, and the grammatical and
syntactical differences between languages. For example, the Hebrew word Ntanf
(na4tan), meaning “to give,” is translated by thirty different Greek words in the
LXX.41  Conversely,  one  Greek  word  may  stand  for  several  Hebrew  words.42

40Tov, “Text of the Old Testament,” p. 172.
41Some of these are a0podi/dwmi (apodido4mi, “to give back,” 23 times), di/dwmi (dido4mi, “to give”
1,456 times), paradi/dwmi (paradido4mi, “to give over, hand over,” 132 times), ti/qhmi (tithe4mi,
“to place, set, lay down, lay aside,” 139 times).

42In Is 13:20—14:4 of the LXX, the Greek word a)napau/w (anapauo4, “to cause to rest, to give rest,
refresh, or revive”) is used six times in various forms to translate four different  Hebrew

Second, it is not always possible to tell if divergences reconstructed from the
various versions arise from discrepancies in the Hebrew text or from idiosyn-
crasies of the translators, who may have modiﬁed the text, either intentionally
or unintentionally.43 Despite these difﬁculties, suggested reconstructions of the
original text from translations of the versions may provide important evidence
when used carefully.44 Third, it is important to know which translations are re-
lated so that particular readings are not given too much weight. For example,
the LXX was the basis for the Old Latin, Sahidic, Ethiopic, Syro-Hexapla and
Georgian versions. In addition, works such as the Vulgate are translations of
an original Hebrew text and yet were heavily inﬂuenced by Greek and Old
Latin  versions.  When  related  versions  agree  on  a  particular  variant,  they
should be given the weight of only one version.

There have been some interesting changes in the study of the ancient ver-

sions and recensions, as Al Wolters points out:

Although  a  substantial  majority  of  the  biblical  texts  discovered  in  the  Judean
desert can be classiﬁed as proto-Masoretic, it is nevertheless true that the Qumran
ﬁnds have served to draw the attention of scholars to the variety of text forms cur-
rent around the turn of the era. Paradoxically, the opposite is true of recent schol-
arship on the ancient versions. Whereas the versions had previously provided the
chief evidence for readings that diverge from the MT, it is now becoming increas-
ingly clear that the proto-Masoretic textual tradition underlies a good deal of the
ancient versions, at least in certain phases of their textual transmission.45

43Tov cautions: “When a detail in a translation differs from the Massoretic text, one need
not  immediately  assume  that  its  Vorlage  differed  from  the  Massoretic  text.  Such  differ-
ences are also caused, even in larger measure, by other factors such as exegesis, transla-
tion technique, and the transmission of the text of the versions” (“Text of the Old Testa-
ment,” p. 172).

6.2.1 Samaritan Pentateuch (SP)

Sargon II (721-705 B.C.) deported 27,290 Israelites from the Northern Kingdom
to Assyria following their defeat in 721 B.C. and imported Assyrians from var-
ious parts of his empire to live in this newly defeated land. In time the Jews
intermarried with the Assyrians, producing a race known as the Samaritans.
The Jews living in Judah looked down on the Samaritans since they were not
full Jews, and a schism developed between these two groups. The Samaritans
built a temple for worship on Mt. Gerizim and accepted only the Pentateuch
as authoritative Scripture, probably for theological and political reasons.46 

46The Samaritans rejected the rest of Scripture for at least two reasons. Theologically, begin-
ning with Joshua and Judges, Shiloh is chosen as their place of worship, not Mt. Gerizim.
Politically, in the book of Joshua the land was allotted only to the Israelite tribes and thus
Samaritans would be considered trespassers.

The SP

47 is a Samaritan version of the ﬁrst ﬁve books of the Old Testa-
ment  that  developed  sometime  after  the  schism—exactly  when  is  uncer-
tain, but a date about 100 B.C. is probable. While little is known about the
earliest period of the SP, it appears to have been accepted by the early pa-
tristic writers as a viable text, though the early rabbis rejected it largely be-
cause it was written in a form of paleo-Hebrew script and it contradicted
Jewish traditions.48 The Abisha Scroll, the most famous sacred scroll of the
Samaritan  community  at  Nablus  (Shechem),  is  a  combination  of  various
fragments; the oldest, dated to the eleventh century A.D., contains the main
part of Numbers 35 to Deuteronomy 34. Few manuscripts of the SP predate
the thirteenth century A.D. and Waltke, after examining the primary manu-
scripts  dating  from  the  thirteenth  to  sixteenth  centuries,  concluded  that
the  SP  “is  a  uniform  tradition  drifting  away  from  the  MT  through  scribal
error.”49 

The existing copies of the SP appear to have been revised after the proto-MT
because they use more matres lectionis and fewer archaic endings than the MT.
There are about six thousand differences between the SP and the MT, mostly
minor spelling or grammatical changes.50 However, several expansions of the
text differ signiﬁcantly from the MT.51 The SP also tends toward harmonization
(to bring into accord with the MT) or conﬂation (to combine readings from two
manuscripts). After the discovery of the Qumran materials, a whole new area
opened up for comparative studies. Several Qumran manuscripts show simi-
larities to the SP primarily in the harmonistic expansions, only without the sec-
tarian  modiﬁcations  (4QpaleoExodm,  4Q158,  4QTestim,  4QNumb,  4Q364,
4QDeutn). This may have been the type of text used by the Samaritans to make

47Technically the SP is a recension of only part of the Old Testament and not a translation, but
it can be conveniently handled with other ancient versions. Shemaryahu Talmon associates
the SP with the versions and says “in this respect [the SP] falls in line with those translations,
in the sense that it is a popular edition of the Pentateuch in the Hebrew language” (“The
Samaritan Pentateuch,” JJS 2 [1950-1951]: 149).

48See Bruce K. Waltke’s interesting history of scholars’ developing views of the SP in “Samar-

itan Pentateuch,” ABD 5:932-33.

49Ibid., p. 935. Judith E. Sanderson states: “it is easy to recognize the relatively few harmoniz-
ing and clarifying expansions in the pre-Samaritan DSS [Dead Sea Scrolls] and the SP. When
those are discounted, the  SP agrees substantially with the text behind the  MT” (“Ancient
Texts and Versions of the Old Testament,” in New Interpreter’s Bible [Nashville: Abingdon,
1994], 1:299.)

50Several scholars argue that the SP is written in a different dialect than the Hebrew of the MT,
accounting  for  numerous  differences:  Rudolf  Macuch,  Grammatik  des  samaritanischen  He-
bräisch (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1969), pp. vii-x; Alexander Sperber, “Hebrew Based upon Greek
and Latin Transliterations,” HUCA 12/13 (1937/1938): 151-53.

51For example, Gen 4:8; Ex 1:22; 2:21; 6:9; 7:19-20, 22, 26, 28; 14:12. See also Bruce K. Waltke,
“The Samaritan Pentateuch and the Text of the Old Testament,” in New Perspectives on the
Old Testament, ed. J. Barton Payne (Waco, Tex.: Word, 1970), pp. 212-39.

their Torah.52 The relationship among Qumran literature, the LXX and the SP is
a matter of debate. Judith Sanderson has studied this relationship quite closely,
and Wolters summarizes her research as follows: 

She concludes that the Hebrew textual traditions represented by the LXX, the MT,
and the Samaritan Pentateuch were originally quite close, but that the ﬁrst went
its own way relatively early and developed an expansionist tendency, while the
second and third stayed close together for some time. A century or so before the
turn of the era, the pre-Samaritan tradition separated from the proto-Masoretic
tradition and underwent some major expansions. Finally, the canonical form of
the Samaritan Pentateuch was reached through a number of speciﬁcally sectarian
expansions, especially relating to Mount Gerizim as a cultic center rather than
Jerusalem.53

It was once thought that when the LXX and the SP agreed against the MT, the
reading of the former two should be preferred. But now it is believed that a Pal-
estinian manuscript taken into Egypt formed the basis for the LXX, so that both
the SP and the LXX are actually distant members within the same family of texts
(i.e., texts that are similar to one another because they derive from related texts).
This explains why the SP and LXX share at least 1,600 variants from the MT.54 It
is interesting that the SP appears to be closer to the MT than some of the so-called
pre-Samaritan texts found at Qumran. Waltke suggests why: 

The closer agreement of the Sam. Pent. with the MT than with some earlier mss of
QL [Qumran literature] may be due to the inﬂuence of proto-MT on that collateral
line of text from which the Sam. Pent. derives. Proto-MT may have been adopted by
the Pharisees as early as 175 B.C., allowing time for its inﬂuence on the proto-Sa-
maritan text-type before the emergence of the sectarian recension at 100 B.C.55

The SP is valuable to Old Testament textual criticism because, as Würthwein
points out, “it is a very important witness to a form of the text that once en-
joyed widespread use as shown by its agreements with the Qumran texts, the
Septuagint, the New Testament, and some Jewish texts that escaped revision
by ofﬁcial Judaism.”56 However, it actually turns out to be of little value for es-
tablishing  original  readings  of  the  MT  because  of  several  signiﬁcant  limita-

52While some expansions in Qumran texts were seemingly inﬂuenced by the SP, none of the

readings considered to be “sectarian” Samaritan readings appear.

ran: 4QpaleoExodm and the Samaritan Tradition, HSS 30 (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1986), p. 311.
54Ralph W. Klein says there are about 1,600 correlations between the LXX and SP (Textual Crit-
icism  of  the  Old  Testament:  The  Septuagint  after  Qumran,  GBS:OTS  [Philadelphia:  Fortress,
1974], p. 17), whereas Würthwein maintains there are approximately 1,900 (Text of the Old
Testament, p. 43).

tions:57 (1) it is probably a popularized
revision of the text of the Old Testament;
(2) no manuscripts of the SP precede the

57Waltke states it this way: “The Sam. Pent. is of little value for establishing original readings. Out
of eighty-ﬁve readings where Sanderson thought she could assign preferable readings involv-
ing the MT, LXX, Sam. Pent., and Qm, she found no variants where the Sam. Pent. uniquely or
even with LXX preserves the preferable reading (1986:85-88)” (“Samaritan Pentateuch,” 5:938).
58For  example,  in  Gen  22:2  the  SP  states  that Abraham  was  about  to  offer  up  Isaac  on  Mt.
Moreh near Shechem (a chief place of worship for the Samaritans) instead of Mt. Moriah,
as in the MT. And in Deut 12:5 the SP identiﬁes “the place which the Lord your God shall
choose” as Gerizim, where the Samaritan temple stood, but later in the MT this place is de-
termined to be Jerusalem.

6.2.2 Aramaic Targums (or Targumim)

Following the return from exile in 538 B.C., the Jewish people primarily spoke
Aramaic (Neh 8:7-8; 13:24) and grew increasingly less familiar with Hebrew.
As a result the Scripture lessons needed to be translated into Aramaic and be-
came known as Targums. Some Targums contain a literal translation of the He-
brew text (e.g., Targum Onkelos), whereas others are paraphrastic (adding in-
terpretive  and  explanatory  material;  e.g.,  Targum  Neoﬁti).59  Philip  S.
Alexander explains how these more paraphrastic translations arose: “It came
to be recognized, however, that the Targum could do more than provide a sim-
ple rendering of Scripture into everyday speech: it could be a commentary as
well as a translation, and impose a comprehensive interpretation on the origi-
nal  Hebrew.”60 At  ﬁrst  these  explanations  were  given  extemporaneously  by
the scribes and teachers, it being strictly forbidden to put them into writing;
thus  various  oral  versions  existed  simultaneously.61  It  later  became  obvious

ids: Eerdmans, 1986), p. 116. Würthwein suggests that the Aramaic translation was to be
given orally in the worship service to separate it from the sacred text (Text of the Old Testa-
ment, p. 79). See also Gamaliel I (mid-ﬁrst century A.D.) who was not willing to recognize a
targum of Job (Shabbat 115a; cf. Tosefta Shabbat 13, 2).

that to standardize these translations, they would have to be written. There are
targums  for  every  book  of  the  Hebrew  Bible  except  Ezra-Nehemiah  and
Daniel; two targums were even found at Qumran (11QtgJob; 4QtgLev).62

The  interpretive  element  in  the  targums  is  clear;  scribes  tended  to  para-
phrase, use explanatory phrases and reinterpret the text in order to better con-
vey its meaning. There were two primary schools of textual study: a western
school centered in Palestine at Tiberias, which existed until the end of the third
century  A.D.  and  then  again  from  the  eighth  to  tenth  centuries  A.D.;  and  an
eastern school centered in Babylonia at Sura, Nehardea (destroyed in A.D. 259),
and  later  at  Pumbeditha.63  Unlike  the  Palestinian  school,  the  Babylonian
school ﬁnally produced an ofﬁcial version of the targum about the ﬁfth cen-
tury A.D., but it gradually lost its inﬂuence and by the tenth or eleventh cen-
tury A.D. had disappeared. Fragments of seven manuscripts of the Palestinian
Targum, dating from the seventh to the ninth centuries A.D., have been found
in the Cairo Genizah and greatly add to our knowledge of this targum.64 Today
only a fraction of these written Aramaic targums has survived; the major ones
are listed below according to the biblical books. 

6.2.2.1 Pentateuch. There are more known targums for the Pentateuch than
for any other part of the Old Testament, probably because of its importance the
Jewish people. Since at least the Middle Ages, Targum Onkelos has been the
ofﬁcial Babylonian targum of the Pentateuch and has been widely accepted by
the Jews as the most authoritative targum for the Pentateuch.65

• Neoﬁti I (Biblioteka Apostolica Vaticana, Codex Neoﬁti I). This targum has
been in the Vatican Library since 1956 when it was given to the library as
part of a collection from the Pia Domus Neophytorum in Rome. A colophon
dates this manuscript to A.D. 1504, but the text that is copied may be as old
as the third to fourth centuries A.D. Neoﬁti I is a nearly complete Palestinian
targum (missing only thirty verses for various reasons); the main text ap-
pears to have been written by three different scribes. It contains numerous
glosses added in the margins or between the lines. Its translation is midway
between the literalness of Targum Onkelos and the paraphrastic nature of
Targum Jerusalem I.

• Targum Jerusalem I  (sometimes erroneously called Pseudo-Jonathan). This
targum  is  represented  by  two  manuscripts:  editio  princeps  prepared  by
Asher Forins, from Venice, in 1591 and the British Museum Ms. Add. 27031.
Its present form dates to seventh to eighth centuries A.D. Targum Jerusalem
I combines the ofﬁcial Targum Onkelos with much more material so that it
is almost twice as long as the MT. This other material appears to come from
a variety of sources, including the Palestinian Targum and other later rab-
binic sources.

• Targum Onkelos. This targum is represented by several manuscripts housed
at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (Mss. 131, 133a, 152, 153)
and Ms. Ebr. 448 at the Vatican Library. It is generally dated between the
second to the ﬁfth centuries A.D. and is also the most literal of the targums.

• Fragment Targum (Targum Jerusalem II). This targum is represented by Ebr.
440, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana; MS Hébr. 110, Bibliothèque Nationale,
Paris;  etc.  It  is  dated  to  the  seventh  to  the  ﬁfteenth  centuries  A.D.  (some-
where  between  Neoﬁti  and  Jerusalem  Targum  I).  Little  of  this  work  re-
mains,  but  it  appears  to  contain  midrashic  material  from  the  Palestinian
Targum.

• Cairo Genizah Mss. These include at least nine fragmentary manuscripts of
Targums for the Pentateuch. They are dated anywhere from the eighth to
fourteenth centuries A.D. Some of these fragments contain the full Hebrew
verse, while others include only lemmata (i.e., the opening words of a verse).
For the most part they represent the Palestinian targum, though they are
not always in agreement in places where they overlap.

• Toseftot.  Some  manuscripts  that  contain  Toseftot  (or  additions)  are  Ms.
Parva 3218; Ms. Sasson 282; Ms. Heb. e. 74 (Oxford); and Ms. T-S NS 184.81
(Cambridge). The date of these additions is uncertain. Some of the manu-
scripts  of  Targum  Onkelos  have  additional  haggadic  materials  (rabbinic
statements that illustrate the Torah) that are labeled “Tosefta Yerushalmi.”

6.2.2.2 Prophets. Targum Jonathan was the ofﬁcial Babylonian targum of the
Prophets and was probably translated by Rabbi Joseph ben H9ayya (c. A.D. 270-
333), head of the academy of Pumbeditha (b. B. Bat. 3b; Yoma 32b).

• Targum Jonathan. This targum is dated from the fourth to ﬁfth centuries A.D.
and  is  represented  by  several  Yemenite  manuscripts  with  supralinear
pointing (Ms. 229 Jewish Theological Seminary of America; Mss. Or. 2210
and 2211 British Museum) and Western Ms. with Tiberian pointing (Codex
Reuchlinianus). The ofﬁcial Babylonian Targum of the Prophets was prob-
ably translated by Rabbi Joseph ben H9ayya (c. A.D. 270-333), head of the acad-

emy of Pumbeditha (b. B. Bat. 3b; Yoma 32b). It bears many similarities to
Targum Onkelos; though not generally expansive, it includes a signiﬁcant
amount of Haggadah.

• Toseftot. The additions to Targum Jonathan are written in the margins or in
the  text  itself.  They  may  be  remnants  of  the  Palestinian  Targum  of  the
Prophets that were retained by scribes when the Babylonian Talmud began
to predominate the West. About eighty additions appear in the Codex Re-
uchlinianus though their date is uncertain.

6.2.2.3 Writings. There is no ofﬁcial targum for the Writings, but the medieval

writers usually quote from Targum Yerushalmi (= Jerusalem) for these books.

• Targum  Yerushalmi  (=  Jerusalem).  The  date  is  uncertain.  This  targum  for
each of the books is very different and often appears in more than one re-
cension.

Technically the targums are not translations or paraphrases but commen-
taries on the biblical books; most can be dated no earlier than the ﬁfth century
A.D. Nevertheless they are important to textual criticism for several reasons:
(1)  they  may  contain  early  traditions  concerning  the  reading  of  the  text;  (2)
they include early Jewish traditions as to the interpretation of the biblical texts;
and (3) they are written in Aramaic, which is closely related to biblical Hebrew.
The quality of the translation varies greatly among the targums, but on the
whole they reﬂect the proto-MT (except a Targum of Job found at Qumran). The
Palestinian targums are generally more paraphrastic in nature than the Baby-
lonian targums, with the exception of the two Palestinian targums found at
Qumran, which are quite literal.

the  LXX,  though  some  scholars  question  its  veracity.66  It  states  that  Ptolemy
Philadelphus  (285-246  B.C.)  wanted  to  assemble  a  great  library  and  collect
books from all over the world. Demetrius, his librarian, informed him that the
Jewish Law was indeed worthy to be placed in his library, but ﬁrst it would
have to be translated into Greek. An Egyptian delegation was sent to Jerusa-
lem to inform the Jewish high priest, Eleazar, of the plan. When Eleazar heard
of it, he was very pleased and sent to Egypt a copy of the Hebrew Law written
in  gold  letters,  along  with  seventy-two  rabbis  (six  from  each  of  the  twelve
tribes) for this translation project. According to Aristeas, the seventy-two rab-
bis translated the Pentateuch in seventy-two days on the island of Pharos, and
after they compared their work, the Jewish community accepted it with joy. As
Ralph W. Klein points out, however:

Later, as the story was retold in the early church, it got “better and better.” Ac-
cording to Justin Martyr, the translation included the whole Old Testament. Later
in the second century Irenaeus reports that the translators worked in isolation
but  came  up  with  identical  results,  thanks  to  the  inspiration  of  God.  Finally,
Epiphanius of Salmis (314-403) pushed the isolation idea to the limit. He had the
translators do everything in pairs, even going by thirty-six boats each night to
dine with the king. When the thirty-six independent translations were read be-
fore the king, they were found to be completely identical.67

The word Septuagint is complicated for several reasons: (1) there is no set
deﬁnition, and scholars differ in the way they use it (e.g., some use Septuagint
only for the Pentateuch, others for the entire Jewish-Greek corpus; some who
realize that every extant manuscript is corrupt and thus only partially repre-
sents  the  original  Greek  translation  prefer  to  speak  of  an  Ur-Septuagint  or
proto-Septuagint);68 (2) there is no standard LXX, for there are signiﬁcant differ-

cies in this letter: “Most notable is the mention of Demetrius of Phalerum as chief librar-
ian—a position he never held in the court of Ptolemy II since the latter, on his accession had
banished  him  to  exile.  Another  error  is  the  mention  of  Menedemus  of  Eritria  as  being
present at the banquet held in honor of the translators when he had already been dead two
years before the end of Ptolemy I Soter’s reign. Several other points of detail suggest the
improbability of the story being historical, among which is the matter of a Greek king being
so interested in the Hebrew scriptures, to go to great lengths to secure them. In fact the idea
of Greeks translating the religious scriptures of such a minority of their population is highly
improbable” (“Septuagint,” ABD 5:1096).

ences and corruptions in each of its Greek manuscripts; and (3) there is little
agreement as to the books that are included in the LXX (i.e., biblical books, bib-
lical and apocryphal books or biblical, apocryphal and some pseudepigraphal
works). Melvin K. H. Peters, one of the leading LXX experts today, provides the
following deﬁnition:

For convenience, it is assumed throughout what follows that a single set of
original translations of the Hebrew scriptures into Greek was effected in sev-
eral stages, and in locations not known for sure; that the earliest parts (most
likely the Torah) of the translation took place in the 3d century B.C.E. (perhaps
in Egypt) and the last parts were completed by the ﬁrst part of the 1st century
B.C.E.; that, in the absence of “hard copy” of these translations, we can recover
from the extant witnesses, texts sufﬁciently reliable to be considered equiva-
lent  to  the  originals,  if  carefully  controlled  text-critical  principles  are  em-
ployed.69

This deﬁnition appears to be the standard hypothesis of the majority of
Septuagintalists, but in actual fact, the situation may be much more compli-
cated than this deﬁnition suggests, as Peters has already indicated, for it is
possible that there were multiple Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible cir-
culating contemporaneously.70 Also the LXX may have been completed earlier
than Peters indicates; the prologue to Ecclesiasticus suggests that by about
132 B.C. each of the three parts of the Hebrew Bible had already been trans-
lated into Greek:

You are urged therefore to read with good will and attention, and to be indulgent
in cases where, despite our diligent labor in translating, we may seem to have
rendered  some  phrases  imperfectly.  For  what  was  originally  expressed  in  He-
brew  does  not  have  exactly  the  same  sense  when  translated  into  another  lan-
guage. Not only this work, but even the law itself, the prophecies, and the rest of
the books differ not a little as originally expressed.71

It is possible that Ben Sira’s grandson is thinking of another Greek transla-
tion, but the LXX would be the most plausible one. There is also reliable patris-

and Lucian in the third and fourth centuries A.D. (see The Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint

tic testimony dating it to about 280 B.C.,72 papyri fragments of parts of the To-
rah  that  go  back  to  the  second  century  B.C.  (Rahlfs  801,  805,  819,  957)  and
fragments of the Minor Prophets to late ﬁrst century B.C. to early ﬁrst century
A.D. (Rahlfs 943).

Historically, the LXX had an important inﬂuence on both Jews and Chris-
tians. As the Greek language was disseminated throughout the ancient Near
East by the conquests of Alexander the Great, it became more and more im-
portant  to  have  the  Scriptures  in  a  language  that  the  people  could  under-
stand. Jewish immigrants living in the cosmopolitan city of Alexandria were
forced by their situation to abandon their native language, but the translation
of their laws into Greek was one way for them to maintain their faith. The LXX
became  so  popular,  however,  that  it  was  increasingly  seen  as  the  standard
form  of  the  Old  Testament  and  was  subsequently  adopted  by  Christians.
About 70 percent of the New Testament’s quotations of the Old Testament ap-
pear to come from the LXX. By the late fourth century A.D., Augustine even de-
manded that Jerome use its order of the books for his translation rather than
the Hebrew order.73 The LXX was eventually rejected by the Jewish commu-
nity because it was embraced by Christians as a sacred book. The more that
Christians embraced the LXX and used it to argue their beliefs (e.g., Is 7:14),
the further the Jewish community distanced themselves from it. Furthermore,
as scribes began to accept as authoritative the MT, Jews rejected the LXX, which
was not based on this text. New Greek translations were being made by Jew-
ish scholars (e.g., Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion) to meet their needs. Many
modern scholars believe that manuscripts of the LXX derive from one original
tradition, as Paul A. de Lagarde (1827-1891) argued a century ago,74 but that
text is almost impossible to recover. It is also interesting that one of the major
differences  between  the  MT  and  the  LXX  is  found  in  the  book  of  Jeremiah,
which is approximately one-seventh shorter in the LXX. Two fragmentary He-
brew manuscripts have been found at Qumran that reﬂect the shorter text of
the LXX (4QJerb,d).

At the beginning of the twentieth century, scholars used primarily the LXX
for Old Testament textual criticism. In some books the LXX provides a very lit-
eral Greek translation of the Hebrew text (e.g., the Pentateuch), but in others
(e.g., Jeremiah, Job and Daniel) it differs greatly from the MT. Until the discov-
ery of the Dead Sea Scrolls there was little ﬁrm evidence to determine which

text  was  preferable.  However,  more  recently  there  are  several  areas  in  LXX
studies where scholars are ﬁnding some agreement. First, scholars now gener-
ally agree that many of the differences between the LXX and the MT are the re-
sult of a translator’s free rendering or a misunderstanding of a Hebrew text
and that the Hebrew Vorlage of the LXX is often substantially the same as the
MT.75 Second, the LXX (often called the Old Greek text) has undergone revisions
that have brought it into closer conformity to the MT. (One of the texts is the
so-called kaige recension [or “proto-Theodotion”];76 another is the asterisked
material in the LXX of Job).77 Third, it was once common to argue that the read-

ings of the LXX were older and therefore more original than the MT, but since
the discoveries of the Qumran scrolls this assumption is no longer warranted
because the proto-MT can be traced back at least as far, if not further, than the
Old Greek (or proto-LXX) and has often been shown to be a similar Hebrew text
to the MT that underlies the LXX’s readings. 

Peters describes some of the problems associated with ﬁnding the original

text of the LXX: 

The task of the modern editor of the LXX is thus not one of picking from equals
but rather of sorting and making, at every stage, critical judgments about a vast
array  of  uneven  witnesses,  following  well  established  principles  which  only
sometimes can be clearly articulated. . . . One critical part of the editor’s task is to
address demonstrably Hexaplaric readings—both pluses and minuses—en route
to determining the critical text. In this regard the readings of the early papyri are
scrutinized carefully and given due consideration but not automatic preference,
since they too may be corrupt.78

Peter Gentry summarizes current LXX studies:

Although a multitude of apparent differences exist between the LXX and MT or
other Hebrew witnesses, we must ﬁrst eliminate issues arising from differences
between  source  and  target  languages  as  codes  of  communication,  corruption
with the transmission of the Greek version, and differences which are transla-
tional and not genuinely textual. When such differences are eliminated (as more
than twenty-ﬁve years of careful, patient, and painstaking comparison of the LXX
and MT have shown), the ﬁrst datum from this study is the high level of agree-
ment between the two. The claim made by Gilles Dorival in his research on the
text of the Greek Psalter is that the majority of differences between it and MT are
translational. The same is true in Job as I concluded in my own extensive study.
In  Proverbs,  two  major  recent  studies  conducted  independently  of  each  other
concluded that the LXX is a creative re-shaping of the MT to strengthen the attri-
bution to Solomon. . . . It is the nature of things that textual critics focus on the
differences. Let us not forget that the LXX witnesses to the fact that our Hebrew
text is, for the most part, ancient and pristine.79

The  LXX  was  never  intended  to  be  a  precise,  scholarly  translation  but  an

early popular recension of the MT.80

Manuscript evidence for the text of the LXX is extensive; some of the more

important manuscripts are:

• Amherst  Collection.  First  acquired
by  Lord  Amherst  in  Norfolk,  En-
gland, and later purchased by John
Pierpont  Morgan  and  transferred
to  the  Pierpont  Library  in  New
York. It includes portions of Gene-
sis,  Exodus,  Deuteronomy,  Job,
Proverbs and Isaiah, dated between
the  fourth  to  ninth  centuries  A.D.
One  of  its  most  important  manu-
scripts  is  an  early  fourth-century
A.D. fragment of Genesis 1:1-5.

turies  A.D.,  include  portions  of
Genesis, Numbers, Deuteronomy,
Psalms,  Isaiah,  Jeremiah,  Ezekiel,
Daniel, Esther, ﬁfteen New Testament books and 1 Enoch. Important works
are CBP 967-968 = Daniel (third century A.D.); CBP 961 = Genesis 9:1—44:22;
CBP 962 = Genesis 8:13—9:1; and CBP 963 = portions of Numbers and Deu-
teronomy.

• Oxyrhynchus Papyri. A large collection found in Oxyrhynchus, Egypt, from
about 1897 onward; housed in many museums (British Museum; Cairo Mu-
seum; Bodleian Library, Oxford; etc.). It includes portions from at least the
Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Psalms and the Prophets, and these date
from the ﬁrst to ninth centuries A.D. Its important works include Oxyrhyn-
chus 656 = Genesis 14—15, 19—20, 24, 27.

• Rylands Papyri. A collection at John Rylands University Library in Manches-
ter, England. It includes manuscripts containing portions of Genesis, Deu-
teronomy, Chronicles, Job and Isaiah, and dates from the second century
B.C. to the ﬁfth century  A.D. Important works include Papyrus Greek 458
(Rahlfs 957) = parts of Deuteronomy, and Papyrus Greek 460 (Rahlfs 958) =
parts of the later chapters of Isaiah.

• Freer Collection. A collection housed at the Freer Gallery of Art in the Smith-
sonian Institute in Washington, D.C. This collection contains manuscripts
of Deuteronomy and Joshua, the Minor Prophets and Psalms, and these are
dated to the third to ﬁfth centuries A.D. Important works include Washing-
ton Greek Ms. Deuteronomy and Joshua; Washington Greek Ms. V Minor
Prophets; and Washington Ms. Psalms.

• Société Egyptienne de papyrologie. In 1943 this society was given thirteen frag-
ments of a papyrus scroll containing Deuteronomy 18, 20, 24—27, 31—32
dated to the late second to early ﬁrst centuries B.C. It is commonly called
P. Fouad Inv. 266 and is one of the oldest witnesses to the Greek Old Testa-
ment.

Some of the more important major uncials of the LXX are:

• Codex Vaticanus (Vatican Library Cod. Gr. 1209). This manuscript, dated to
the fourth century A.D., was in the Vatican Library since at least 1481 until
Napoleon took it to Paris with other manuscripts as a war prize. In 1815 it
was  returned  to  the  Vatican  Library.  Originally  it  was  a  complete  manu-
script, but now several sections are missing (Genesis 1:1—46:28a; 2 Samuel
2:5-7,  10-13;  Psalm  105  [106]:27—137[138];  1-2  Maccabees;  and  Hebrews
9:14 to the end of the New Testament). Each page has three columns written
in black ink on vellum (calfskin). There are no breaks between words, punc-
tuation is rare, and some sacred names are abbreviated.

• Codex Sinaiticus (B.M. Add. 43725). Count von Tischendorf found this co-
dex, dated to the late fourth to early ﬁfth centuries A.D., at St. Catherine’s
Monastery in the Sinai Desert. Later the monks gave it as a gift to the czar
of  Russia,  then  in  1933  it  was  sold  to  the  British  Museum  for  £100,000
(≈ $500,000). It contains portions of the Old Testament, the Apocrypha and
all of the New Testament. It also contains part of the Shepherd of Hermas and
the entire Epistle of Barnabas. It has four columns written in black ink on vel-
lum, without spaces between words, accents or breathing marks.

• Codex  Alexandrinus  (B.M.  Royal  I.D.V-VIII).  Cyril  Lucar,  the  patriarch  of
Constantinople, gave this codex to King James I, but it came to England in
1627 after his death. Lucar probably acquired it in Alexandria, Egypt, hence

its  name.  The  British  Museum  received  the  codex  in  1757  from  the  royal
family. It is dated to the mid-ﬁfth century A.D. and originally it was a com-
plete codex of the Old Testament and New Testament, as well as 1-2 Clement
and the Psalms of Solomon. However, the codex is now missing the follow-
ing:  parts  of  Genesis  (14:14-17;  15:1-5,  16-19;  16:6-9),  part  of  1  Samuel
(12:20—14:9), nine leaves in the Psalms (49[50]:19—79[80]:10) and some of
the New Testament. This codex has two columns per page and is written in
black ink on vellum without word divisions, accents or breathing marks.

• Codex Ephraemi (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale Gr. 9). Housed in the national
library in Paris since at least the mid-sixteenth century, this codex was ﬁrst
deciphered by Tischendorf, who later published it in 1845. This codex is a
palimpsest, with the earliest text dating to the ﬁfth to sixth centuries A.D.
However, in the twelfth century someone erased the biblical text and wrote
the sermons of Ephraem, a Syrian church father, over it. Originally it con-
tained the entire Bible, but presently has only sixty-four leaves of the Old
Testament (including portions of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon,
Job), part of the apocryphal books (Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach), and
145 leaves of the New Testament. The codex is made of vellum and has one
column per page without word divisions, accents or breathing marks.

The  LXX  is  important  to  Old  Testament  textual  criticism  for  two  reasons:
First, in some instances it reﬂects a tradition of the Hebrew text different from
the MT. Second, where they agree, it provides evidence as to how the scribes at
this time thought the text was to be pointed and understood. One must re-
member, however, that the LXX is a translation from Hebrew into Greek with
the same kinds of difﬁculties inherent to all translations. Attempting to iden-
tify the original Hebrew Vorlage of the LXX is much more complicated than ear-
lier scholars thought. Peters states it this way: 

The foregoing discussions should make clear that the Greek version, although
translated from Hebrew, was not necessarily translated from a text accessible to
us. The most important reason for studying the LXX then is to read and under-
stand the thought of Jews in the pre-Christian centuries. In the process we may
gain insights into the Hebrew Bible.81

This  difﬁculty is represented dramatically in the  LXX version of  Jeremiah
and Job, both of which are about one-sixth shorter than the MT. Does this mean
that the translator of the LXX followed another Hebrew version of the book of
Jeremiah or Job that was shorter, or that he abbreviated the text for some rea-
son?  This  problem  was  highlighted  when  Hebrew  texts  with  the  shortened

form  of  Jeremiah  (4QJerb,d)  were  found  at  Qumran.  Peter  J.  Gentry  offers  a
plausible explanation for this shortening: 

The earliest Greek translation of Job is about one-sixth shorter than the Hebrew
text  of  MT.  For  almost  a  hundred  years  the  standard  view  among  Septuagint
scholars was that the Greek translator had used a different parent text and some
thought that the MT was derivative and secondary to the Hebrew base of the Sep-
tuagint.  Yet  painstaking  comparison  of  our  Greek  and  Hebrew  texts  clearly
showed  that  the  differences  were  due  to  a  functional  equivalence  approach  to
translation in which many of the long, windy speeches were made more manage-
able for a Hellenistic readership.82

Scholars are beginning to make a distinction between two different classes
of biblical texts: (1) manuscripts that merely reproduce in a straightforward
manner their Vorlage, and (2) manuscripts that contain a revision or updating
of material to reﬂect contemporary circumstances.83 This distinction may help
determine why some texts are so different from others—it may not be that they
reﬂect a different Vorlage but that they are written for a purpose other than
simply reproducing their Vorlage. Our research on the book of Jeremiah found
that everything missing from the LXX text of Jeremiah is found elsewhere in the
book, which may suggest an intentional condensation. 

Still, this does not appear to answer the question regarding the shorter text
of Jeremiah in the LXX since there appear to be Hebrew texts found at Qumran
dated to about 200 B.C. that have a shortened version of the book of Jeremiah
(similar to that found in the LXX). Thus some manuscripts of the Hebrew text
may have already been intentionally shortened or corrupted so that they con-
tained  a  shorter  text.  Is  it  possible  that  a  shorter  text  of  Jeremiah  had  been
maintained around Egypt and was used for the LXX, but that a longer one sim-
ilar to the MT had been maintained in Babylon or Jerusalem? We still do not
have a deﬁnitive answer to this dilemma.

Probably the single most important development in LXX studies for Old Tes-
tament textual criticism is the publication of critical editions that attempt to get
back to the original Old Greek readings:

• The Cambridge  LXX (smaller edition). This portable LXX text was edited by

82Gentry, “Septuagint,” p. 5. For his source on the Hebrew base of the Septuagint see e.g., Ed-
win Hatch, “On Origen’s Revision of the LXX Text of Job,” in Essays in Biblical Greek, ed. Ed-
win Hatch (1889; reprint, Amsterdam: Philo Press, 1970), pp. 215-45.

Henry Barclay Swete between 1887 and 1894 and was the ﬁrst step in prep-
aration for the larger, more complete version of the LXX. It used Codex Vat-
icanus (B) as the base text, which was supplemented by two or three other
uncials. 

• The Cambridge  LXX (larger edition). The earlier editions of this work were
edited by Alan E. Brooke and Norman McLean, and the later ones by Henry
St. John Thackeray. They also used the text of Codex Vaticanus (B) with sev-
eral other witnesses in the apparatus. The apparatus generally includes ci-
tations from the versions and patristic citations, but are not always correct.84
This project was halted in 1940 and does not appear to be resuming.

• The Rahlfs LXX. This very popular edition of the LXX is primarily a text based
on the three major uncial manuscripts (Vaticanus, Sinaitieus and Alexandri-
nus) with a critical apparatus with variants from these and several other
sources and was completed in 1935 just before Alfred Rahlfs died. Rahlfs
followed the principles laid out by his teacher Paul de Lagarde, who be-
lieved that all the manuscripts of the LXX were mixed texts and thus the best
readings should be taken from each of them. Peters explains the principles
de Lagarde believed were necessary to get back to the original Greek text:

To restore the text, one: (1) needs to be acquainted with the style of individual
translators; (2) should give preference to a free translation rather than the slav-
ishly exact one, all other things being equal; (3) should give preference to read-
ings pointing to a Hebrew original other than the MT.85

By using these principles Rahlfs believed that he could work back to the

original proto-LXX.

• The Göttingen  LXX. This work basically follows the same principles estab-
lished by Paul de Lagarde, and thus it is an eclectic work seeking to estab-
lish the original reading of the LXX. It is the most comprehensive and reli-
able  critical  edition  of  the  LXX.  To  date  thirty-one  volumes  have  been
produced by several different editors (e.g., Exodus, John W. Wevers; Deuter-
onomium, John W. Wevers; Iob, Joseph Ziegler).

6.2.4 Other Greek Recensions

As Christians increasingly used the LXX as their Scriptures in defense of their
faith, Jews began to distance themselves from it. For their controversies with
Christians as well as for the increasing numbers of Hellenistic Jews whose pri-
mary language was Greek, Jews needed new Greek translations that corrected
misinterpretations, removed Christian additions and accurately reﬂected the
Hebrew text that had become normative in Palestine.86

6.2.4.1 Aquila. Aquila was a Christian from Sinope (in Pontus on the Black
Sea), who converted to Judaism and became a disciple of Rabbi Akiba.87
 About
A.D. 130, he produced a literal Greek translation that is exceedingly helpful to
Old Testament textual criticism because it so closely follows the Hebrew text—
even the Hebrew deﬁnite direct object marker (t)e, )et) which is usually left
untranslated, is indicated by the article or by the Greek adverb su/n (syn, “so,
with, together with”) followed by the accusative case (grammatical case mark-
ing the direct object).88 Jellicoe says that this work “was essentially a teacher’s
book, aimed at giving an exact rendering of the Hebrew and usable only by
one who already understood that language, and its function was interpreta-
tive rather than literary.”89 And Peters states: 

The version of Aquila was respected for many years. Both Origen and Jerome
were impressed with it, the latter even borrowing from the version’s readings in
the case of a few rare words. Aquila is considered in some circles to be identical
with Onqelos, the compiler of a Targum of the Pentateuch and there is virtual
unanimity in Septuagintal circles that the extant text of the Greek of Qoheleth is
to be identiﬁed in some way with him.90 

Aquila attempted to reproduce not only the meaning of the Hebrew Vorlage,
but also its form, and since it was written after the text of the MT had been uni-
ﬁed, it should accurately reﬂect the text at this time. Aquila’s work has been
lost, but many of its readings can be determined from the third column of Ori-
gen’s Hexapla, marginal readings in some codices, patristic citations (esp. Eu-
sebius, Theodoret and Jerome), and several sixth-century palimpsests discov-
ered in the Cairo Genizah (141 verses of Psalms).91

6.2.4.2  Theodotion  (see  6.2.4.6  Kaige  recension).  Early  church  tradition  says
that Theodotion was a Jewish convert who lived in Ephesus during the second
century A.D.92 His Greek translation was midway between the strictly literal
translation of Aquila and the literary elegance of Symmachus. Theodotion suc-
ceeded in producing a translation that retained much of its Semitic ﬂavor and
yet was readily understandable to his Greek-speaking audience. One peculiar-
ity of his work is that he often transliterated rather than translated words, even
fairly common ones.93 It is conjectured that he was preparing this translation
for Jews who, even though their primary language was Greek, were familiar
with some Hebrew words.94

 Peters explains:

ever, Jerome said he was an Ebionite (De Vir. Ill. 54).

The text on which he worked as a reviser seems however to have been different
from the standard LXX and to have been in existence since the early part of the 1st
century B.C.E. For instance, NT citations from the book of Daniel, where a version
generally considered to be Theodotion has supplanted the LXX in all but two mss,
are  drawn  from  the  former  not  the  latter.  Early  Church  Fathers—Clement  of
Rome, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus—cite Theodotion’s text of Daniel. This situation
has led many scholars to postulate an Ur- or a proto-Theodotion in order to ex-
plain the presence of Theodotionic readings before the time of Theodotion.95

There  are  two  other  distinctives  of  this  version:  Job  is  one-sixth  longer
than in the LXX (Theodotion appears to closely follow the MT), and Daniel
differs signiﬁcantly (not merely a revision) from the LXX and eventually su-
perseded  the  LXX  version.  In  some  books  (e.g.,  Exodus,  Joshua,  Job)  The-
odotion’s text corresponds to the sixth column of Origen’s Hexapla, which
he used to “correct” the then current Greek text of the Old Testament, but in
other books (e.g., Minor Prophets, Psalms) his text does not reﬂect the sixth
column.96

Theodotion’s revision of the LXX is helpful to Old Testament textual criti-
cism because it is a very readable translation of the Hebrew text after it had
been  uniﬁed.  In  several  passages  Origen  considered  Theodotion’s  revision
closer to the Hebrew text than to the LXX.

6.2.4.3  Symmachus.  It  is  generally  agreed  that  Symmachus  produced  his
Greek translation after Aquila and Theodotion. References to him or his trans-
lation are noticeably absent from sources in the late second and early third cen-
tury, so that he probably dates to the early to mid-third century, shortly before
Origen compiled the Hexapla.97
 According to Eusebius and Jerome, Symma-
chus was an Ebionite (an early Christian sect considered heretical by the early
Christian fathers for observing some form of the Jewish law).98
 Jerome states
that  Symmachus  excelled  at  expressing  the  sense  of  the  Hebrew  text  as  op-
posed to Aquila’s literal translation, making it more valuable to him in prepar-
ing the Latin Vulgate.99 Symmachus’s elegant Greek style enabled him to pre-
pare an idiomatic translation of the MT that occasionally manifests signiﬁcant
independence and originality. Leonard J. Greenspoon notes that “Symmachus
generally  preferred  to  supply  his  readers  with  translations  (often,  only
guesses) for obscure or technical Hebrew terms that had remained transliter-
ated  in  earlier  Greek  versions.”100  This  freedom  of  style,  which  Symmachus
used to make his translation easy to understand, also renders it less valuable
for text-critical purposes.

6.2.4.4  Origen’s  Hexapla  (c.  A.D.  230-245).  Origen  was  a  Christian  scholar,
most  likely  from Alexandria,  Egypt  (c.  186-253/254  A.D.).  His  most  famous
work, the Hexapla, was one of the greatest achievements of textual criticism in
the early church. It is a six-column compilation of the following Old Testament
versions:

1. The Hebrew text

2. A Greek transliteration (a Hebrew text written in Greek letters) 

3. Aquila’s Greek version  

4. Symmachus’s Greek version

5. A revision of the LXX

6. Theodotion’s Greek version (except in the Psalms and Minor Prophets)

In  some  books  it  is  thought  to  have  contained  even  more  columns  (e.g.,
Quinta, Sexta and Septima). Origen arranged the texts so that the reader could
compare the Hebrew text to the various Greek texts.101 He claimed in a letter
to Julius Africanus (c. 240) that this work was an apologetic tool to aid Chris-
tians in their discussions with Jews and to protect them against the charge of

falsifying the biblical texts:102 “I make it my endeavour not to be ignorant of
their [LXX’s] various readings, lest in my controversies with the Jews I should
quote to them what is not found in their copies, and that I may make some use
of what is found there, even although it should not be in our Scriptures.”103
Origen employed particular sigla or signs, developed originally by Alexan-
drian classical scholarship (the Aristarchian symbols), to indicate how the LXX 
), the 
differed from the Hebrew text. These signs, called the obelos (—, 

—. —..

), were used as follows:104

metobelos (

), and the asterisk (

• Words that are in the LXX but not in the original Hebrew text and should

thus be deleted were placed between an obelos and a metobelos (e.g., 
fau=sin th=v gh=v 

, Genesis 1:14).

• Words in the original Hebrew text but not in the LXX were borrowed from
another column (usually Theodotion’s text) and placed between an asterisk
and a metobelos (e.g., 

 “ kai\ e)ge/ne to\ ou3twv 

, Genesis 1:7).

Origen’s main concern was the ﬁfth column, which could be compared to

the Hebrew text. Peters summarizes the problems with the Hexapla:

That would have been an acceptable condition had the Hexapla been retained in
its original form, or if Origen did only what he claims to have done. But he seems
in fact to have adjusted his text without always indicating where he did, and also
the  extant  witnesses  to  the  Origenian  recension  do  not  everywhere  retain  the
Hexaplaric signs. Equally problematic was the situation Origen faced when there
was variance between the Greek and the Hebrew necessitating a choice from one
of the three versions, and when those versions themselves were divergent from
each other. His tendency to choose the version closest to the Hebrew meant that
in effect the ﬁnal form of the ﬁfth column was conservative, mixed, and in the last
analysis, not much more than a Greek version of Origen’s Hebrew.105

This work was indeed monumental, comprising ﬁfty volumes106 estimated
at about 6,500 pages.107 Ironically, Origen’s Hexapla, which he intended to con-
ﬁrm the authority of the LXX, later had the opposite effect, as Klein notes:

The  history  of  the  LXX  was  adversely  affected  by  Origen’s  Hexapla  since  it

tended to obliterate the most original and distinctive features of the Old Greek,
led to the neglect of some genuine Old Greek manuscripts, and led to the inser-
tion into others of many non-genuine readings. Various church fathers consulted
the Hexapla before its destruction in the seventh century, but the entire Hexapla,
running to almost 6,500 pages, was never copied. Instead, it became customary
to copy only the ﬁfth column. Once removed from the Hexapla, however, the as-
terisks and obeli of this column would be meaningless—something like footnote
numbers without footnotes.

108

LXX

Many copies of the 

 have been corrupted because they followed the text
of the Hexapla without the asterisks and obeli. These mixed texts are commonly
called “hexaplaric,” a term indicating that their text follows the combined read-
ings  of  the  Hexapla.  Fortunately,  some  manuscripts  were  not  affected  by  the
“hexaplaric  manuscripts,”  such  as  much  of  Codex  Vaticanus  (B)  (except  for
small parts of the book of Isaiah). The Syro-Hexapla is also helpful for determin-
ing these readings for it is a copy of Origen’s Hexapla translated into Syriac by
Paul, bishop of Tella, in the early seventh century (c. 618-619). It records fairly
accurately the Aristarchan signs Origen included in his text.

109

The Hexapla presumably remained in Caesarea and was destroyed with the
rest of the library during the Arab invasions in the early seventh century, but sev-
eral manuscripts contain examples of the Hexapla: (1) a palimpsest in Milan con-
tains columns 2 to 6 (column 6 is the Quinta version)
 and is fairly extensive (35
folios of approximately 150 verses), (2) a smaller fragment contains Psalm 22 with
all six columns, (3) Codex Sarravianus (G) and Codex Coislianus (M) contain the
text of the Pentateuch and some of the historical books with critical symbols, and
(4) the Chigi manuscripts (86 and 88) contain the Prophets and critical symbols.
The Hexapla’s primary contributions to Old Testament textual criticism are its
Greek translations from Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion, and its Hebrew
text from Origen’s time, which was compiled after the 

 had been uniﬁed.

6.2.4.5 Other recensions of the LXX. According to Jerome (c. A.D. 342-420), the
early church used other recensions of the LXX. The following three were more
prominent:

• Origen’s Palestinian recension. It is generally believed that Origen’s recension
constitutes the ﬁfth column in his Hexapla and that it is restricted to the Old
Testament, unlike the recensions of Hesychius and Lucian.111 Origen was an
able  scholar,  well  aware  of  the  differences  among  the  various  manu-
scripts.112 For example, he notes that “there are many passages through the
whole  of  Job  which,  though  present  in  the  Hebrew,  are  lacking  in  our
own.”113 Jellicoe summarizes the primary purpose of Origen’s work:

His  principal  concern  was  not  with  the  construction  of  a  text,  but  rather
with the presentation of the evidence, leaving the reader to make his own
judgement in that light. . . . [Origen] adopts a “standard” text as his basis;
lacunae are ﬁlled from what, in his judgement, was the most reliable read-
ing; the remaining columns which constitute his apparatus criticus are pre-
sented quite objectively, leaving the reader in each case at liberty to draw
his own conclusions.114

Origen’s Vorlage was probably a “mixed text,” not derived from a single text
type; however, it appears to have come mainly from an Alexandrian text type,
which is generally considered the earliest and most accurate.

• Lucian’s recension. One of the most important posthexaplaric recensions of
the LXX was the work of Lucian, but it is difﬁcult to know if a Lucianic text
for the entire Old Testament ever existed.115 Lucian was said to be a presby-
ter of Antioch who died as a martyr in A.D. 311/312 during the Maximilian
persecution. In Synopsis sacrae Scripturae Pseudo-Athanasius describes Lu-
cian and his work as follows: “Using the earlier editions [i.e., Aquila, The-
odotion and Symmachus] and the Hebrew, and having accurately surveyed
the expressions which fell short of or went beyond the truth, and having
corrected them in their proper places, he published them for his Christian
brethren.”116 His recension was most likely preserved by two Syrian church
fathers, John Chrysostom (A.D. 344-407) and Theodoret (A.D. 386-457), since
they often quote a Greek text (possibly Lucianic) different from the LXX.117
There are also marginal readings that are marked with the sigla kai lambda
(the  Greek  letter  “l”)  in  some  Greek  manuscripts  and  the  Syriac  letter

“lomadh” (L) in some Syriac manuscripts, which most scholars suggest re-
fers to Lucianic readings.118 Lucian’s text tends toward stylistic purity, reg-
ularly replacing Hellenistic forms (Greek forms after Alexander the Great)
with Attic (earlier) ones. It also contains a full eclectic text, often with con-
ﬂated readings.119 The manuscripts 19, 82, 93 and 108 were identiﬁed as Lu-
cianic by Antonio M. Ceriani, Frederick Field and Paul de Lagarde.120 Tov
suggests that there is a close agreement between the Lucianic tradition and
4QSama, but he admits that because of the corrupt nature of the manuscript,
these ﬁndings may be misleading.121

An interesting debate has centered around the possibility of a so-called Ur/
proto-Lucian text that appears to have readings similar to certain other Lucian
texts before Lucian wrote this text. Metzger claims that proto-Lucian readings
appear in certain parts of the Old Latin (c. second century A.D.), the Peshitta
version of the Old Testament, a papyrus fragment of Psalm 77:1-18 (second or
third century A.D.), quotations from Justin Martyr (c. mid-second century A.D.)
certain New Testament quotations, some biblical quotes from Josephus of Sam-
uel-Kings and second-century papyrus fragments of Deuteronomy.122 Several
modern scholars still question the existence of a proto-Lucianic text.123

• Hesychius of Egypt (Alexandria). Hesychius was a common name, making it dif-
ﬁcult to identify this translator. It has been frequently suggested that he was
the Egyptian bishop who coauthored a letter with Theodorus, Pachymius and
Phileas, bishop of Thmuis, to Melitius, bishop of Lycopolis in Egypt, protest-
ing  what  they  considered  to  be  irregular  exercise  of  episcopal  functions  in
their dioceses.124 Eusebius mentions his martyrdom in the same section as that
of Lucian of Antioch (HE 8.13.7). Peters explains its origin: “While the Hexapla
was copied in Caesarea for use in Palestine, two other revisions were in circu-
lation, so Jerome informs us, one for use in Egypt and the other in Antioch.
These recensions are identiﬁed with Hesychius and Lucian respectively.”125

Jellicoe has recently argued that the Codex Vaticanus was generally considered
to represent primarily the Hesychian recension.126 It is now generally recognized,
however, that little is known about this recension; even its existence is debated.

6.2.4.6 Kaige recension (8H9evXIIIgr, Rahlfs 943): This Greek scroll found in
1953 in a cave at Nah[al H9ever contains portions of the Minor Prophets (Jonah,
Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Zechariah and possibly also Amos).
According to paleographic evidence, it dates to the ﬁrst half of the ﬁrst century
A.D. It has a revised Old Greek text that is related to the MT but not as fully de-
veloped. Peters has summarized the characteristics of this revision identiﬁed
by Barthélemy and his followers:

(1) The use of kaige to translate Hebrew gam and we6gam [this is where it gets its
name]; (2) the use of ane4r  rather than hekastos to represent Hebrew )|<s\; (3) a ten-
dency to use ep/apano4then as a translation of the Hebrew m(l in contrast to  LXX,
which uses apo or epano4; (4) the elimination of the historical present in favor of the
aorist as a translation of the Hebrew waw-consecutive with the imperfect in narra-
tion; (5) tendency to stress the atemporal nature of Hebrew )e=n by translating it as
ouk estin; (6) use of the ego4 eimi as a translation of Hebrew )a4no4k|< and to distinguish
it from )a4n|<; (7) avoidance of eis apante4sin as a translation of Hebrew lqr)t; (8) a ten-
dency toward transliteration, especially of unknown words; (9) a tendency to sys-
tematize the Greek equivalents of speciﬁc Hebrew words or roots. Further reﬁne-
ments and characteristics of this recension have also been proposed.127

Barthélemy says that its text is closer to the MT than to the LXX,128 but he also
questions  the  existence  of  a  translator  in  the  second  century  A.D.  Peters  ex-
plains the current situation concerning this revision:

Some scholars have been persuaded completely by Barthélemy, and now argue
that a 2d century Theodotion is no longer necessary, suggesting that Ur-/proto-
/kaige-Theodotion was all there was, and that this reviser ﬂourished towards the
end of the 1st century B.C.E., his work being the basis for both Aquila’s work and
Symmachus’ in light of the demonstrable similarity of all three in so many in-
stances.  Other  scholars,  recognizing  that  Barthélemy’s  thesis  and  assumptions
raised as many problems as they solved, have been more cautious and maintain

that the historic Theodotion may have worked as a reviser within the tradition
reﬂected by the earlier so-called Ur-Theodotion. Questions have also been raised
as to whether or not the so-called Theodotion text in Daniel is to be attributed to
Theodotion,  or  whether  the  sixth  column  of  Origen’s  Hexapla—traditionally
considered to be Theodotion—is indeed what it has been claimed to be.129

The text also appears similar, if not identical, to Origen’s Quinta, which is
reﬂected in some of the citations of Justin Martyr (c. A.D. 103-165), a few read-
ings of the Sahidic Coptic version and in the Greek Codex Washingtonensis.130
Peters also says, “Barthélemy identiﬁed the work of the Reviser (who has been
later called kaige-Theodotion) in other parts of LXX—Lamentations, Ruth, the B
text of Judges, the Theodotionic text of Daniel, the Theodotionic supplements
to LXX Jeremiah and Job, and in the Quinta of the Psalter.”131

literature, philosophy, rhetoric, mathematics, music and logic. Robert M. Wil-
son summarizes Philo’s importance:

Quite  apart  from  the  inﬂuence  exercised  by  his  writings  on  later  Christian
thought and exegesis, his works are a primary source of information for the Ju-
daism of the Dispersion, for the ideas current in NT times, for the ways in which
Jews of the period could react to the thought and culture of a predominantly gen-
tile environment, and for the extent to which it was possible to harmonize the
Old Testament with Greek philosophy. At the same time, our lack of material for
comparison makes it hard to say how far he is truly representative, how widely
these ideas were shared.132

Philo was a deeply religious man and steadfastly loyal to Judaism; thus his
works can be seen in some measure as a defense of Judaism, a natural response
since Alexandria was a center of anti-Jewish propaganda. He wrote widely,
but  most  valuable  to  Old  Testament  textual  criticism  are  his  quotes  from  a
Greek version of the Old Testament. His text is often close to the LXX, but in
several places it reﬂects more closely the readings of the Hebrew text. As Peder
Borgen states:

Many details of the textual afﬁnities of Philo’s LXX text are uncertain, particularly
because he sometimes departs from the LXX readings. The reason is that in the
paraphrasing  expositions  Philo  deals  with  the  text  as  an  active  exegete;  more-
over, he works exegetical traditions into his paraphrase. Thus, it is impossible to
reconstruct an original LXX text on the basis of his exegesis.133

Philo may have used other Greek versions of the Old Testament that were
being circulated at the time, because some of his readings correspond quite
closely to the later translators Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion.134

A Brief History of New Testament
Textual Criticism

This chapter describes the historical developments that gave rise to New Testa-
ment textual criticism beginning as early as Origen and continuing to modern
eclectic texts of the New Testament.

At the beginning of the church’s history, Christians could learn from eyewit-
nesses to Christ and the apostles and share the knowledge that they had accu-
mulated.  Papias,  a  second-century  bishop,  says  he  prefers  this  method  of
learning:

but  if  ever  anyone  came  who  had  followed  the  presbyters,  I  inquired  into  the
words of the presbyters, what Andrew or Peter or Philip or Thomas or James or
John or Matthew, or any other of the Lord’s disciples, had said, and what Aristion
and the presbyter John, the Lord’s disciples, were saying. For I did not suppose
that information from books would help me so much as the word of a living and
surviving voice.”1

However, as time went on fewer and fewer of those eyewitnesses remained,
and the need arose for these sacred traditions to be recorded to safeguard their
accuracy.  Few  individuals  could  afford  even  a  portion  of  Scripture,  so  they
would have had to go to their local churches to hear the reading of Scripture
and its instruction. Several of Paul’s letters exhort the churches to read his let-
ters (1 Thess 5:27; 1 Tim 4:13) and even to pass them on to other churches (Col
4:16).  This  suggests  that  the  letters  were  to  be  copied  and  sent  to  other
churches; however, in time errors would have crept into the text.

Because the New Testament manuscripts have been hand-copied by numerous
(skilled and unskilled) people throughout the life of the text, no two agree exactly

in every instance. The process of New Testament textual criticism can be traced to
copyists  who,  in  an  effort  to  improve  the  text  being  copied,  made  conscious
choices about its preferable reading.2 It was these differences in manuscripts that
led scholars to realize the need for textual criticism: multiple manuscripts could be
compared across passages to determine the more plausible reading.

7.1  Irenaeus 

While it is likely that textual criticism began earlier, one of the earliest recorded
instances of New Testament textual criticism appears in the works of Irenaeus. In
one example Irenaeus (c. A.D. 140-202) preferred a particular reading of Revela-
tion 13:18 because it was “found in all the good [or weighty] and ancient copies.”3

7.2  Origen of Alexandria/Caesarea 

Origen’s  biblical  commentaries  refer  to  New  Testament  readings  that  were
supported by “few,” “many” or “most” of the biblical manuscripts available to
him.4 Origen (A.D. 185-254) complained that “the differences among the manu-
scripts [of the Gospels] have become great, either through the negligence of
some copyists or through the perverse audacity of others; they either neglect
to check over what they have transcribed, or, in the process of checking, they
lengthen or shorten, as they please.”5

7.3  Jerome 

Jerome  (c.  345-420)  tediously  sifted  through  numerous  Old  Latin  manuscripts
when  producing  the  Latin  Vulgate  (completed  between  A.D.  382-405).  Eldon  J.
Epp explained the process Jerome used to choose between readings: “Jerome . . . ,
who took note of variant readings, considered an older ms [manuscript] to carry
more weight than a recent one, and preferred readings that best suited a passage’s
grammar or context.”6 Jerome even suggests that variant readings were possibly
the result “of confusion of similar letters, confusion of abbreviations, accidents in-
volving  dittography  and  haplography,  the  metathesis  of  letters,  assimilation,
transpositions, and deliberate emendations by scribes.”7

2Eldon J. Epp, “Textual Criticism (NT),” ABD 6:427. Bruce M. Metzger says that Theodotus, a
leather merchant who was excommunicated as a heretic by Pope Victor (A.D. 187-198), was
the ﬁrst to use textual criticism (The Text of the New Testament, 3rd ed. [New York: Oxford Uni-
versity Press, 1992], p. 150).

torisches Museum, Vienna, Austria/Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY]

Jerome lamented the great diversity of Latin manuscripts, stating that there
are “almost as many forms of text as there are manuscripts.”8 This seems to
suggest  that  the  Latin  texts  used  by  Jerome  were  already  signiﬁcantly  cor-
rupted. Bruce Metzger describes Jerome’s methodology:

He used a relatively good Latin text as the basis for this revision, and compared
it with some old Greek manuscripts. He emphasizes that he treated the current
Latin text as conservatively as possible, and changed it only where the meaning
was distorted.9

Jerome’s comparison of manuscripts to determine the best reading of the text
was textual criticism. Jerome’s translation, the Latin Vulgate, reigned virtually
unchallenged in Europe for over one thousand years as the New Testament text,
even though in time the Vulgate text incorporated copyist errors of its own.10

7.4  Erasmus of Rotterdam

During the Renaissance, Erasmus of Rotterdam (c. 1466-1536) attempted at least
limited  textual  criticism  when  preparing  his  edition  of  the  Greek  New  Testa-
ment in 1516. Erasmus endeavored to complete this task as quickly as possible
because another Greek text published in 1514, called the Complutensian Poly-
glot, could not gain sanction from Pope Leo X. In 1522 both Old and New Testa-
ments (with Hebrew lexicon and grammar) of the polyglot were published, and

they  subsequently  received  the  sanc-
tion of the pope. Erasmus had hoped
to  ﬁnd  reliable  Greek  manuscripts  to
prepare  his  Greek  text,  but  the  only
manuscripts  available  on  such  short
notice  required  signiﬁcant  correction
before they could be sent to the printer.
Metzger  describes  Erasmus’s  process
of determining the text:

Since  Erasmus  could  not  ﬁnd  a
manuscript which contained the en-
tire Greek Testament, he utilized sev-
eral for various parts of the New Tes-
tament. For most of the text he relied
on  two  rather  inferior  manuscripts
from a monastic library at Basle, one
of the Gospels . . . and one of the Acts
and Epistles, both dating from about
the  twelfth  century.  Erasmus  com-
pared them with two or three others
of the same books and entered occa-
sional  correction  for  the  printer  in  the  margins  or  between  the  lines  of  the  Greek
script. For the book of Revelation he had but one manuscript, dating from the twelfth
century, which he had borrowed from his friend Reuchlin. Unfortunately, this manu-
script lacked the ﬁnal leaf, which had contained the last six verses of the book.11

Figure 7.2. Erasmus of Rotterdam (c. 1466-
1536)  painted  by  Holbein,  Hans  the
younger [Galleria Nazional, Perma, Italy/
Scala/Art Resource, NY]

For the last six verses of the book of Revelation and in several other places,

Erasmus translated the Latin Vulgate back into Greek.

When  Erasmus  compared  manuscripts  to  choose  between  readings,  he
used some of the same principles, at least in elementary form, that were devel-
oped  by  later  text  critics.12    However,  even  Erasmus  later  admitted  that  his
Greek text was “precipitated rather than edited.”13

7.5  Brian Walton 

The ﬁrst work to systematically collect variant readings of the Greek New Tes-
tament was the London Polyglot Bible (1655-1657) by Brian Walton (1600-1661).

This  work  contained  Robert  Esti-
enne’s Greek text from the 1550 edi-
tion  (better  known  as  Stephanus’s
Greek  text)  and  recorded  at  the  bot-
tom  of  the  page  variant  readings
from  Codex  Alexandrinus.  Eldon
Epp  explains:  “Alexandrinus,  which
had  come  to  light  in  1627,  was  as-
signed the symbol ‘A’ by Walton and
was a major factor in the now increas-
ing activity of collecting variant read-
ings  and  displaying  them  in  critical
editions of the Textus Receptus.”14 In
the sixth volume Walton inserted an
appendix  prepared  by  Archbishop
Ussher  of  variant  readings  from  ﬁf-
teen different sources.15

7.6  Other Greek Texts

Figure 7.3. Brian Walton, (1600-1661) com-
piler of the London Polyglot [Paul Wegner]

Other  notable  works  followed  that
compiled  variant  readings  among  Greek  manuscripts.  In  1675  Dr.  John  Fell
(1625-1686), dean of Christ Church and later bishop of Oxford, edited a Greek
New Testament based on the Elzevir brothers’ Greek text of 1633 (the Elzevir
brothers  published  seven  editions  between  1624-1678);  in  an  apparatus  Fell
claims to have compared it with one hundred manuscripts and versions. 

Just two weeks before he died, John Mill (1645-1707), a teaching fellow from
Queen’s College, Oxford, published his Greek text in which he collated evi-
dence from manuscripts, early versions and church fathers. He asserted that
there were thirty thousand variants in the few New Testament manuscripts he
was familiar with. Epp summarizes Mill’s work well:

The sheer size of this body of variants raised disturbing questions about the valid-
ity of the textus receptus; beyond that, in his prolegomena and textual notes Mill
enunciated several important text-critical principles, including the judgment that
the more obscure a reading, the more authentic, and he implied that genealogical
relationships  may  exist  between  mss.  For  his  achievements,  Mill  appropriately
may be called the founder of modern New Testament textual criticism.16

Others also collated various manuscripts and added increasingly compre-

hensive critical apparatuses to the Greek text in order to correct what became
commonly  known  as  the  Textus  Receptus  (e.g.,  Edward  Wells,  1709-1719;
Richard Bentley, 1720; Daniel Mace, 1729).

7.7 Johann Bengel 

While a student at Tübingen a German scholar named Johann Bengel (1687-
1752), was so disturbed by the thirty thousand variants in the Greek manu-
scripts published by John Mill that he devoted himself to studying the trans-
mission  of  the  Greek  text.  He  collected  as  many  editions,  manuscripts  and
early  versions  as  were  available  and  carefully  examined  them.  His  work
showed that there were far fewer variants than originally thought and that no
variant  affected  any  article  of  evangelical  doctrine.17  Bengel  was  the  ﬁrst
scholar to divide the manuscripts into groups and weigh them rather than as-
sume they were of equal value. In 1734 he published a Greek text that closely
followed the Textus Receptus; in the apparatus he classiﬁed the relative value
of each reading according to the following categories: a = the original reading,
with full certainty; b = a reading superior to the Textus Receptus, though with
less than absolute certainty; g = a reading equally as good as the one in the text;
d = a reading not as good as the one in the text; and e = an inferior reading that
was to be rejected.18 Bengel explained the principles by which this apparatus
was developed; one of his key principles was “the difﬁcult is to be preferred
to  the  easy  reading.”  This  principle  included  several  caveats  and  has  since
been further reﬁned, but it remains a primary principle of textual criticism. Be-
cause his Greek text challenged the authority of the Textus Receptus, he was
ostracized by some even though he was known to be a very pious man.19

7.8  Johann Jakob Griesbach 

From 1775 until his death, Johann Griesbach (1745-1812), professor of New Tes-
tament at the University of Jena (in Germany) traveled to England, Holland and
France to collate New Testament manuscripts. He also devoted much time to ex-
amining New Testament quotations in the writings of the church fathers. And
he gave attention to several ancient versions that until that time had been little
studied: the Gothic, Armenean and the Philoxenian Syriac versions.20 Metzger
claims that he “laid the foundations for all subsequent work on the Greek text of
the New Testament.”21 Most New Testament textual critical scholars recognize
the three recensions into which Griesbach divided the New Testament manu-

criticism. The ﬁrst reads: “The shorter reading (unless it lacks entirely the au-
thority of the ancient and weighty witnesses) is to be preferred to the more ver-
bose, for scribes were much more prone to add than to omit.”22 While Gries-
bach  sometimes  would  rely  too  heavily  on  a  mechanical  adherence  to  his
system of recensions, by and large he was a careful and cautious scholar. He
was also the ﬁrst German scholar to abandon the Textus Receptus in favor of
what he believed to be, by means of his principles, superior readings.

7.9  Karl Lachmann

Karl Lachmann (1793-1851), professor of classical philology at Berlin, was the
ﬁrst scholar to publish a Greek New Testament based entirely on textual critical
principles. Although he considered it impossible to reproduce the original text,
his aim was to compile a text signiﬁcantly earlier than the Textus Receptus. In
his own words: “Down with the late text of the Textus Receptus, and back to
the text of the early fourth-century church.”23 Epp describes his method:

His aim was to formulate the text as it had existed just prior to A.D. 400, and his
bold method was to lay aside the entire established traditional text and to draw
his own text from the oldest Greek uncials, the Old Latin and Vulgate, and some
early fathers such as Origen, Irenaeus, and Cyprian.24

Lachmann’s  Greek  Text  (1831)  indicated  with  brackets  words  that  had
doubtful textual support and listed passages that differed from the Textus Re-
ceptus.  However, his editions of the Greek New Testament in 1831 and 1842-
1850 fell short of reproducing the text of A.D. 380, partially due to his slender
use  of  manuscript  evidence.  Nevertheless,  his  work  turned  New  Testament
textual criticism in a new direction, as Fenton J. A. Hort explains:

A new period began in 1831, when for the ﬁrst time a text was constructed di-
rectly from the ancient documents without the intervention of any printed edi-
tion,  and  when  the  ﬁrst  systematic  attempt  was  made  to  substitute  scientiﬁc
method for arbitrary choice in the determination of various readings. In both re-
spects the editor, Lachmann, rejoiced to declare that he was carrying out the prin-
ciples and unfulﬁlled intentions of Bentley, as set forth in 1716 and 1720.25

7.10  Constantin von Tischendorf 

Modern  New  Testament  textual  critics  probably  owe  the  most  to  a  German
Protestant theologian and textual scholar named Lobegott Friedrich Constan-
tin von Tischendorf (1815-1874), who dedicated his life to preparing for publi-
cation as many manuscripts and fragments of the New Testament as possible
(see  ﬁgure  6.17).  He  actually  produced  eight  editions  of  the  New  Testament
(1841-1872) and  nearly two dozen volumes of New Testament manuscripts.26
In a letter to his ﬁancée, Tischendorf states: “I am confronted with a sacred task,
the struggle to regain the original form of the New Testament.”27 During his
lifetime he discovered and published more manuscripts and fragments of the
New Testament than any other single scholar.28 He relentlessly searched the li-
braries of Europe and the Near East in search of New Testament manuscripts.
At the age of twenty-ﬁve he began the laborious task of deciphering the pal-
impsest codex Ephraemi; this manuscript of a ﬁfth-century Greek text was re-
used by Ephraem, a Syrian church father in the twelfth century. One of Tischen-
dorf’s  most  important  ﬁnds  was  the  Codex  Sinaiticus  at  St.  Catherine’s
Monastery, near the foot of what was believed to be Mt. Sinai. Tischendorf ex-
amined the manuscripts, versions and writings of the church fathers available
in his day. Even though these sources were a fraction of what are available to-
day, his comprehensive and accurate work paved the way for those to follow.

A Brief History of New Testament Textual Criticism

215

Brooke F. Westcott (1825-1901; Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, and
later bishop of Durham) and Fenton J. A. Hort (1828-1892; Hulsean Professor
of Divinity at Cambridge) gained renown for their studies of New Testament
manuscripts and the publication of their critical edition of the New Testament.
In 1881, after twenty-eight years of work, Westcott and Hort published the
text of the Greek New Testament (with an introduction and appendixes) titled
The New Testament in the Original Greek. Not being interested in simply supply-
ing a textual apparatus with all the variant readings, they reﬁned and applied
textual principles from earlier scholars to determine what they believed to be
the original Greek text, as Epp explains:

The very title of their work, The New Testament in the Original Greek, shows that
their  goal  was  far  more  ambitious  than  those  of  Bentley  or  Lachmann—who
wanted to establish the 3d-and 4th-century texts, respectively—for Westcott and
Hort sought and claimed to be reproducing the original text itself.29

This was indeed an ambitious goal, but Westcott and Hort took advantage
of  the  versions  and  New  Testament  quotations  in  ancient  authors  and  the
church fathers to formulate their text. Manuscripts were divided into four text
types—Syrian,  Western,  Alexandrian  and  Neutral.  The  “Neutral  text”  was
represented  by  the  fourth-century  uncials,  namely  Codex  Vaticanus  and
Codex Sinaiticus, but could also be traced back further into the mid-second
century A.D. They believed the “Neutral” text-type to be closer to the original
Greek text than any of the other three text types. They considered the Syrian
text type (which we now call Byzantine) to be the latest since no distinctly Syr-
ian  readings  were  found  in  any  of  the  church  fathers  of  the  third  century,
whereas they are numerous in the latter fourth century, especially in the area
of Antioch (Syria). Epp summarizes their conclusions:

A  major  conclusion  was  that  the  Syrian  text  had  not  yet  been  formed  by  the
mid-3d  century  and  that  of  the  other  three  that  lay  behind  it,  the  two  oldest
were competing texts in the earliest traceable period: the Western and the Neu-
tral. (The Alexandrian text, since Westcott and Hort, has generally been classi-
ﬁed with the Neutral, though the term “Alexandrian” has been retained to de-
scribe the combined entity.)

The question that remained for Westcott and Hort concerned which of these
earliest  pre-Syrian  text  types  (Neutral  or  Western)  represented  the  original,
since both—according to them—had 2d-century claims. There was no way by
which Westcott and Hort could bring their historical reconstruction to reveal—
on historical grounds—which of the two was closer to the original New Testa-
ment text.30

BROOKE FOSS WESTCOTT (1825-1901)
Westcott was born in Birmingham, England, on January 12, 1825, where
he attended King Edward VI’s School. He was greatly inﬂuenced by the
headmaster,  James  Prince  Lee,  who
in  Westcott’s  opinion  was  “superior
. . . among the great masters of his
time.”a  He  attended  Trinity  College,
Cambridge, in 1844 and became a
teaching fellow in 1849. Some of his
own pupils were Joseph B. Lightfoot,
Edward W. Benson and Fenton J. A.
Hort. In 1851 he was ordained at the
parish church in Prestwich by his old
teacher  Dr.  James P. Lee,  who  was
then  bishop  of  Manchester,  and  the
next  year  went  to  teach  at  Harrow
School as assistant master.

Figure  7.4.  Brooke  F.  Westcott
[Paul D. Wegner]

Westcott  returned  to  Cambridge
for a brief stay in 1855 where he met
the famous German textual critic Tischendorf, with whom he was unim-
pressed for his seemingly exclusive interest in “palimpsests and codices.” b
In 1869 Westcott was appointed canon of Peterborough and the next year
was called to Cambridge University as Regius Professor of Divinity, through
the instigation of Lightfoot. He was very involved in the life of the university,
both in administration and pastoral concern. He helped found and orga-
nize the Cambridge Mission to Delhi and the Cambridge Clergy Training
School (later called “Westcott House”). In 1875 Westcott was appointed
honorary chaplain to the Queen. During this time his most noted work on
New Testament textual criticism with Fenton J. A. Hort progressed, and in
1881 it was published. In 1890, at the age of sixty-six, he was appointed
to succeed Lightfoot as Bishop of Durham, where he showed a deep con-
cern for ordination candidates at Auckland Castle and for the social and
industrial problems in his diocese. For the next ten years, with ever failing
health, he maintained his strenuous work traveling between Durham and
London until his death on July 27, 1901.

FENTON JOHN ANTHONY HORT (1828-1892)
Hort was born in Dublin, Ireland, in April 1828. At age nine he moved with
his family to Cheltenham, England, and the following year to Boulogne in
the  north  of  France,  where  he  became  interested  in  classics.  His  family
later returned to Cheltenham where
he continued his education and en-
in  October
tered  Rugby  School 
1841.  In  1846  he  attended  Trinity
College,  Cambridge,  where  he  be-
came  very  interested  in  religious
things  and  sought  out  evangelicals,
but they seemed to him almost care-
less in their forms of worship. As a re-
sult,  Hort  continued  to  vacillate  be-
tween 
the  old,  stable  Anglican
religion  that  he  had  grown  up  with
and the new, creative ideas that were
taught at Cambridge.

Figure  7.5.  Fenton  J.  A.  Hort
[Paul D. Wegner]

He graduated from Cambridge with ﬁrst-class honors in both moral and
natural  sciences  and  was  considered  one  of  the  university’s  inﬂuential
thinkers. Being offered a fellowship in 1852 at the same time as Joseph B.
Lightfoot, he chose the ﬁeld of New Testament. Hort was ordained in 1854
and retained his Cambridge fellowship until his marriage in 1857, when
he  moved  to  a  country  parish  in  Ippolyts-cum-Great  Wymondley,  near
Hitchin, where he pastored for ﬁfteen years. His spare time was devoted
to revising the Greek New Testament. He was ﬁnally asked to return to
Cambridge in 1871 to take up a fellowship and lectureship in theology at
Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In 1878 he was offered the position of
Hulsean  Professor  of  Divinity  and  by  1881  his  work  with  Westcott  was
completed. Hort continued his work at Cambridge despite failing health
until his death on November 30, 1892.

7.12 Present State of New Testament Textual Criticism

Westcott and Hort evaluated the various manuscripts of the text types accord-
ing to internal evidence to see which manuscripts and text types in general
were more reliable and in this way attempted to determine the more accurate
text types. Their text-critical principles deemphasized manuscripts that were
later, read more smoothly, were harmonized or contained conﬂated readings,

such as their so-called Syrian text type. Likewise, those texts that were early
but contained paraphrase or assimilation were not favored (e.g., the Western
text type). Older manuscripts that they believed contained little corruption or
contamination (as the text type name “Neutral” implied) were emphasized.
There is little doubt that Westcott and Hort gave too much weight to the Neu-
tral text type, but their textual critical work provided the ﬁnal blow to the Tex-
tus  Receptus.  These  two  scholars  laid  the  groundwork  for  the  continuing
study of the text of the Greek New Testament; their classiﬁcations have been
carefully reﬁned and many of their text-critical principles remain in use today.
Several other critical editions of the Greek text appeared following Westcott
and Hort: Richard F. Weymouth (1886), Bernhard Weiss (1894-1900); the British
and Foreign Bible Society (1904, 1958), Alexander Souter (1910), Hermann von
Soden (1911-1913); and Eberhard Nestle’s Greek text, the Novum Testamentum
Graece,  published  in  1898  by  the  Württemberg  Bible  Society,  Stuttgart,  Ger-
many. The Nestle text went through twelve editions (1898-1923) and then was
taken over ﬁrst by his son, Erwin Nestle (13th-20th editions, 1927-1950), then
by Kurt Aland (21st-25th editions, 1952-1963) and ﬁnally was coedited by Kurt
Aland and Barbara Aland (26th-27th editions, 1979-1993).

Epp critiques the Nestle-Aland text as follows:

As everyone knows, Nestle’s edition—from its beginning and for many years to
follow—was based simply on a majority vote among the texts in the editions of
Tischendorf, Westcott-Hort, and Weymouth or (later) Weiss, that is, Nestle chose
among competing readings by selecting the one supported by two of these three
editions. Nestle’s edition put forth no other principles for determining the text
and certainly offered no theory of the text—both of which are prominent features
of editions like those of Tischendorf and Westcott-Hort. Furthermore, the Nestle
edition paid “relatively little attention to manuscripts,” as the Alands admit (19).
It comes as a surprise, therefore, to discover that they call the Nestle edition a
“breakthrough” which represents the “conclusive battle” against the textus recep-
tus (18-19).31

Epp goes on to say:

It might be granted them that the Nestle text has been the dominant edition in
terms of practical use down through the years, but it is difﬁcult to see how it has
been a major force at the theoretical level in our discipline, and to that extent their
portrayal supports our characterization of their volume as a revisionist history of
New Testament textual criticism.32

A Brief History of New Testament Textual Criticism

219

In 1955 the American Bible Society, under the initiative of Eugene A. Nida,
called together an international group of scholars to prepare a Greek New Testa-
ment that could be used by hundreds of Bible translation committees to revise ex-
isting Bible translations or make entirely new translations. Many missionaries,
working  all  over  the  world  to  translate  the  New  Testament  into  modern  lan-
guages, needed an accurate and easy-to-use text of the Greek New Testament.
The international team of scholars forming the editorial committee of this new
Greek  text  were:  Matthew  Black  of  St.  Andrews,  Scotland;  Bruce  Metzger  of
Princeton; Allen Wikgren of Chicago; and Kurt Aland of Münster, Westphalia,
Germany.33 This was the beginning of the United Bible Societies’ Greek text called
The Greek New Testament. At the same time, Kurt Aland was working on a new
edition of Nestle’s Greek text that became known as the Nestle-Aland Greek Text.
Today two different critical Greek texts are in use, namely, The Greek New
Testament  (4th  ed.,  1994)  and  the  Nestle-Aland  Novum  Testamentum  Graece
(27th ed., 1993); the text for both is the same even though the textual appara-
tuses differ as follows: (1) the textual notes of the Nestle-Aland text list more
evidence (i.e., a fuller textual history), and (2) the The Greek New Testament (4th
ed.) lists only the evidence that substantially affects the evidence of the text,
but it gives graded evaluations for each textual note so that the reader can de-
termine how certain a variant reading is.

Several ongoing issues are debated among New Testament textual critics:

• Text types: Most scholars subscribe to the principle that “quality is more
important than quantity” (i.e., textual evidence must be weighed and not
merely counted) and that manuscripts must be evaluated as to their accu-
racy and grouped according to textual families so that they can be reason-
ably weighed. There is much less agreement, however, when it comes to de-
termining  text  types  or  groupings.  Epp  voices  the  majority  opinion  of
textual scholars:

It can be argued plausibly that three textual clusters or constellations can
be identiﬁed in reasonably separate groups, and that each ﬁnds its earliest
representatives in papyrus mss and then carries on to one or more major
uncials (cf. Epp 1989c).34

He goes on to give the following clusters of manuscripts:

A Text Group: â84, â68, â42 (â45), Codex Alexandrinus (Gospels)

B Text Group: â75, â66, Sinaiticus, L, 33, 1739

33Later, other members were added to the committee—Carlo M. Martini and since 1982 Jo-

hannes Karavidopoulos and Barbara Aland.

C Text Group: â45, W (Freer Gospels), Family 13, 33, 1739

D Text Group: â29, â48, â38, Codex Bezae, 1739 (Acts), 614, 383

However, it will remain debatable whether these clusters of manuscripts can
be considered text types.

The Alands  are  strong  opponents  of  the  idea  of  textual  traditions  or  text
types. There has been signiﬁcant discussion as to the validity of textual fami-
lies  before  the  fourth  century.  After  examining  in  detail  early  manuscripts
from  mainly  before  the  third  and  fourth  centuries,  Kurt  and  Barbara Aland
have established the following ﬁve categories:35

Category I. Manuscripts of a very special quality that should always be con-
sidered  in  establishing  the  original  text  (e.g.,  the  Alexandrian  text  belongs
here). The papyri and uncials through the third to fourth centuries also belong
here automatically, one may say, because they represent the text of the early
period (if they offer no signiﬁcant evidence, they are bracketed).

Category II. Manuscripts of a special quality but distinguished from manu-
scripts of category I by the presence of alien inﬂuences (particularly of the Byz-
antine text), and yet of importance for establishing the original text (e.g., the
Egyptian text belongs here).

Category  III.  Manuscripts  of  a  distinctive  character  with  an  independent
text, usually important for establishing the original text but particularly im-
portant for the history of the text (e.g., f 1, f 13).

Category IV. Manuscripts of the D (Western) text.
Category V. Manuscripts with a purely or predominantly Byzantine text.
The Alands then categorize all the manuscripts according to the following

notations:

1: agreements with the Byzantine text

1/2: agreements with the Byzantine text where it has the same reading as
the original text

2: agreements with the original text

S:  independent  or  distinctive  readings  (i.e.,  special  readings,  “Sonderle-
sarten”)

This is where the Alands’ research displays a measure of circular reasoning,
for the original text is thought to be the Nestle-Aland’s text, though not every-
one would agree that it contains the most original readings in every instance,
as Epp notes:

35Aland and Aland, Text of the New Testament, p. 106.

2005 Students Guide.book  Page 221  Thursday, June 17, 2010  3:07 PM

A Brief History of New Testament Textual Criticism

221

there is a certain measure of question-begging or circularity of argument in this
schema when, for example, a MS is placed into Category I on the basis of its “in-
cidence of agreements with the original” . . . but when—at the same time—MSS
in Category I constitute those which possess “a very special quality which should
always be considered in establishing the original text.” In addition, there is a fair
measure of prejudgment or arbitrariness if, for example, numerous MSS are au-
tomatically included in Category I merely because of their age and another MS
(P74) is included in that same category despite its age.36

• Criteria for evaluating readings. There is signiﬁcant disagreement concern-
ing the weight to be given to various canons or criteria when determining
textual critical issues. This debate has occurred at two levels: (1) regarding
the speciﬁc criteria used when determining a speciﬁc reading, and (2) how
much weight to give internal and external evidence. This latter issue has
been so hotly debated that three basic methods of criticism have emerged:
historical-documentary,  rigorous  eclecticism,  reasoned  eclecticism,  and
Byzantine-priority (see later discussion on pp. 239-40).

I  consider  the  balanced  approach  of  the  Reasoned  Eclectic  method  to  be
preferable for resolving text-critical issues. However, the Historical-Documen-
tary  method  (emphasizing  external  evidence)  and  the  Rigorous  Eclectic
method  (emphasizing  internal  evidence)  provide  a  healthy  counterbalance
and should still be taken into account.

1 The Text

The modern Greek critical editions are a collection of the best readings from
each of the approximately 5,487 manuscripts and other witnesses to the Greek
text (this is called an eclectic text, whereas a diplomatic edition is primarily a
text from one manuscript). In principle a compilation of the best readings for
each passage provides the best Greek text of the New Testament, though some
scholars would disagree (see later discussion on pp. 239-40).

At the beginning of each textual note are two numbers. The variants of each
biblical chapter are noted by a small superscript number. The next number,
which is larger, indicates the verse number. It is possible for one verse to have
more than one variant. The textual notes provide a great deal of information
about the Greek text, generally in the following order:

of the Greek text to give the reader some indication as to the relative certainty of

some letters are reused (e.g., two “D” sigla represent two different manuscripts:

and  [2]  Claromontanus—a  sixth-century  A.D.  codex  of  the  Pauline  Epistles).

The abbreviations are noted at the front of the UBS Greek text, but we must pay
close attention to the contexts of the manuscripts—when working in the Gos-
pels,  for  instance,  make  sure  that
the  manuscript  sigla  contain  that
part of the text. The following sym-
bols designate this information:

e = Gospels
a = Acts 
c = Catholic or General Epistles 
p = Epistles of Paul
r = Revelation
The  works  are  usually  listed  in
chronological  order  within  their
catogories; the century dates of the
manuscripts  are  noted  in  Roman
numerals  (e.g.,  VI  =  sixth  century
A.D.).

While the textual apparatus of the UBS Greek text provides most of the in-
formation necessary to determine the most plausible original reading of a pas-
sage, the chart on p. 228 may prove helpful when collating and evaluating the
evidence for various readings. The ﬁrst space should be ﬁlled in with the ﬁrst
reading of the text you have chosen to evaluate, with its corresponding Eng-
lish translation. The space directly below labeled “External Evidence,” should
list  the  various  Greek  manuscripts,  Byzantine  lectionaries,  versions  and
church fathers that include that reading of the Greek text. The next column
should list similar information for the next variant and so on. Once the pri-
mary evidence has been written in the columns, you should be able to make a
preliminary evaluation of the external evidence to determine which reading
has the strongest evidence (see principles that can be used to evaluate the ex-
ternal evidence, pp. 231-38). Next, write in any internal evidence that may fa-
vor any of the readings and explain why (see later discussion of internal evi-
dence,  pp.  238-41).   After  a  careful  examination  of  this  evidence,  determine
which reading is most likely the original reading of the text and explain your
conclusions in the last box.

Determining the Most Plausible Reading

This chapter will help the reader understand the process of New Testament tex-
tual criticism: from gathering evidence to becoming familiar with textual fami-
lies, weighing internal and external evidence and evaluating a given reading. The
chapter concludes with several examples of New Testament textual criticism.

Christophe Petyt, a French artist, has turned making exact copies of master-
pieces  into  big  business.  You  choose  the  painting  and  for  anywhere  from
£2,000 to £20,000 ($3,650 to $36,500) he can deliver a painting so close to the
original that the original artist may have a hard time telling them apart. “Our
copies are exact in every detail,” says Petyt. “Sometimes we have the opportu-
nity to put them next to the original, and it really is very, very hard to tell them
apart.”1 William Langley, writer for the Telegraph, explains: 

His Paris-based company, L’Art du Faux, employs more than 80 maitres fournis-
seurs—painters steeped in the style of a particular artist or school. Not a brush-
stroke or smudge escapes them. Every work is individually commissioned and
done from scratch, using new canvases and oil paints, then artiﬁcially aged by a
variety of simple but ingenious techniques.2 

Langley goes on to say, “Surprisingly, it’s all legal, too—including the forg-
ing of artists’ signatures.”3 Unfortunately copyists of New Testament manu-
scripts did not always take the same care as these painters to ensure their cop-
ies were exact.  

Textual criticism is foundational to exegesis and interpretation of the text:
we need to know what the wording of the text is before we can know what it

TYPES OF VARIANTS

1. The greatest number of variants are differences or errors in spelling. For
example, the author of Codex Vaticanus spells “John” with only one “n”
instead of the more common two ( 0Iwa/nnhj [Io4anne4s]). This type of
variant makes no difference in the meaning of the text.

2. The second largest group of variants arises from differences between
Greek and English. For example, in Greek a person’s name may or
may not be preceded by an article (the); or the phrase “the good man”
could also be written in Greek as “the man, the good one,” whereas in
English both phrases are translated as “the good man.” This type of
variant also makes no difference in the meaning of the text.

3.  Sometimes  a  scribe  accidentally  made  nonsense  out  of  a  word  or
phrase when copying. One scribe accidentally wrote the Greek letter p
(pi) instead of f (phi) in Luke 6:41, rendering the text, “Let me take the
fruit  (ka/rpoj  [karpos])  out  of  your  eye”  instead  of  “Let  me  take  the
speck (ka/rfoj [karphos]) out of your eye.” These types of errors are
rare and easy to spot.

means.4  The  process  of  New  Testament  textual  criticism  entails  two  funda-
mental tasks: (1) the study of the extant manuscripts of the New Testament
text, and (2) the evaluation of the evidence from these manuscripts.5 The pri-
mary task of the text critic is to evaluate and critique the variants among the

4Similar types of issues arise in New Testament textual criticism as in Old Testament criti-
cism, for Eldon J. Epp suggests that it is far too simplistic to speak of an “original text” as if
we are able to determine the ipsissima verba (“the very words”) of the original authors since
the  formation  of  the  New  Testament  manuscripts  may  demand  that  there  were  multiple
originals, or at least that there were several layers or levels of meaning (“Issues in New Tes-
tament Textual Criticism: Moving from the Nineteenth Century to the Twentieth Century,”
in  Rethinking  New  Testament  Textual  Criticism,  ed.  David  A.  Black  [Grand  Rapids:  Baker,
2002], pp. 70-75). I prefer Bruce M. Metzger’s statement of the goal of New Testament textual
criticism, namely “to ascertain from the divergent copies which form of the text should be
regarded as the most nearly conforming to the original” (The Text of the New Testament: Its
Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration  [New York: Oxford University Press, 1992], p. v).
While this seems to be a serious issue in the formation of Old Testament books, the multiple
texts  or  levels  do  not  seem  to  be  as  problematic  in  the  formation  of  the  New  Testament
books.

tual Criticism, ed. David A. Black (Grand Rapids: Baker, 2002), p. 77.

New Testament manuscripts. A variant is any difference between the texts in
the numerous manuscripts of the Greek New Testament (e.g., spelling differ-
ences, missing or added words, different word order). Some variants are sig-
niﬁcant; for example, the last eleven verses of the Gospel of Mark. But the vast
majority have little effect on the translation of a passage and are relatively in-
signiﬁcant, a fact that underscores how accurate our Bibles actually are.

It is important to underscore two facts near the beginning of our discussion
on New Testament textual criticism: (1) the verbal agreement between various
New Testament manuscripts is closer than between many English translations
of the New Testament, and (2) the percentage of variants in the New Testament
is small (approximately 7 percent) and no matter of doctrine hinges on a vari-
ant reading.

8.1 Where Do We Start?

The ﬁrst step is to determine where possible errors appear in the text; in New
Testament textual criticism this is fairly easy. The editors of the UBS Greek text
have done much of this work already for you by examining the various Greek
manuscripts, ancient versions and New Testament citations in the works of the
church fathers to see where variants appear. It would be almost impossible for
the average student, or even scholar, to examine all of the extant Greek manu-
scripts, ancient versions and church fathers. At present much of this work is
done  at  the  Institute  for  New  Testament  Research  in  Münster/Westphalia,
Germany, where a reproduction of every Greek manuscript is housed, as well
as much of the evidence from church fathers and ancient versions. The most
important evidence for the variants appears in the textual apparatus at the bot-
tom of each page of the UBS Greek text. The text critic can use this information
to evaluate the strength of a variant reading.

8.2   Collecting the Evidence

There are two types of evidence: internal evidence that comes from within the
text itself (e.g., author’s grammar or spelling habits, use of parallel passages),
and external evidence that comes from outside the text (e.g., various manu-
scripts, versions or quotes from church fathers).

8.2.1  External Evidence

External evidence comes primarily from three different sources that are sum-
marized below:

Each of these areas can supply valuable information to help determine the

most plausible original reading.

8.2.1.1  New Testament Greek manuscripts. There are over ﬁve thousand extant
New  Testament  manuscripts,  ranging  from  small  fragmentary  manuscripts

(â52) to almost complete copies of the New Testament (Codex Alexandrinus).
David A.  Black  states:  “Even  for  the  Book  of  Revelation,  which  is  the  most
poorly  attested  writing  in  the  New  Testament,  over  three  hundred  Greek
manuscripts have been preserved.”6

The earliest manuscripts, written on papyrus, date as early as the second
(â52, â46) or third (â66, â75) centuries A.D. Papyrus is made from the reedlike
papyrus  plant  that  grows  along  the  banks  of  the  Nile  River  in  Egypt.  The
pithy centers of the stalks were sliced and layered horizontally then verti-
cally.  The  papyrus  sheet  was  then  allowed  to  dry;  the  sugar  in  the  plant
caused the slices of the stalk to adhere together, forming a fairly smooth writ-
ing surface.

As a writing material, papyrus was used as early as 2400 B.C. and was very
common in the ﬁrst century A.D. when the biblical texts were written. Papy-
rus is perishable: it can easily be damaged by water or become dry and brittle
when  exposed  to  the  sun,  which  is  why  there  are  so  few  papyrus  manu-
scripts extant today, and those that do exist have primarily been found in the
dry regions of Egypt. There are about 116 papyrus manuscripts known to-
day, and every New Testament book, except 1 and 2 Timothy, is attested in at
least one papyrus manuscript.7 Christians generally used the codex format
instead of scrolls as Jewish scribes did. For example, â52, one of the earliest
New Testament manuscripts, written about A.D. 125, is written on both sides
of the papyrus. (Scrolls were usually written on one side.) Eventually parch-
ment  became  the  preferred  writing  material  (in  about  the  fourth  century).
One parchment manuscript comes from the second or third century (0189),
two from the third century (0212, 0220) and two from the third or fourth cen-
tury (0162, 0171), but from about the fourth century A.D. on, parchment in-
creasingly became more popular. Parchment was a strong and durable writ-
ing surface made from animal hides, generally those of sheep and goats. The
hide was ﬁrst scraped clean of hair and then soaked in lime to lighten the
color. It was then dried and rubbed with chalk and pumice stone to produce
a  smooth,  ﬁne  writing  surface.  One  hide  would  provide  about  four  folios
(pages)  of  ﬁnished  manuscript,  which  then  formed  part  of  a  codex,  as  the
Alands describe:

A manuscript containing a group of New Testament writings in an average for-
mat (about 200-250 folios of approximately 25 x 19 cm.) required the hides of at
least ﬁfty to sixty sheep or goats. This would mean quite a good size ﬂock. . . .

ment book is attested by at least one papyrus manuscript (New Testament Textual Criti-
cism, p. 19).

For a larger manuscript (Codex Sinaiticus was originally at least 43 x 38 cm. in
size) or one of a particularly ﬁne quality of parchment, the expense would have
multiplied. In fact, a manuscript of the New Testament represented a small for-
tune because the preparation of the parchment was only the ﬁrst step. Once it
had been prepared there was still the writing of the text to be done, as well as
the illumination of the initials, and frequently also the addition of miniatures by
an artist.8

Sometimes,  perhaps  due  to  limited  supply  or  high  cost,  parchment  or
leather was cleaned and reused—a new text written over the original writing.
These manuscripts are called palimpsests (“rescraped,” from the two Greek
words pa/lin [palin, “again”] and ya/w [psao4, “to scrape”]. About ﬁfty Greek
New Testament manuscripts are palimpsests—the most familiar being Codex
Ephraemi, a ﬁfth-century A.D. New Testament manuscript that was erased and
replaced  in  the  twelfth  century  by  thirty-eight  sermons  or  treatises  of
Ephraem, a fourth-century Syrian church father.  Parchment continued to be

used even into modern times, but from about the twelfth century on paper in-
creased in popularity.

The invention of paper is commonly attributed to the Chinese in the ﬁrst
century A.D., but it was not until about the eighth century that it was intro-
duced into the Western world by the Arabs. By the ﬁfteenth century, paper
had virtually replaced parchment as the common writing material, and just
in time, since the invention of movable print and the printing press created
a  demand  parchment  could  never  have  met.  The Alands  say  that  “of  the
5,400 known manuscripts of the New Testament, about 1,300 are written on
paper.”9

Another way that New Testament manuscripts are distinguished is by type
of writing, namely, uncial writing (similar to our printed capital letters), used
from about the second to the eleventh centuries, and minuscules (similar to
our  cursive  letters),  used  from  about  the  ninth  to  the  sixteenth  centuries.10
These categories can overlap since papyrus manuscripts were often written in
uncial handwriting. Early uncial Greek texts were written without word divi-
sions, punctuation marks and accents, which sometimes caused problems in
distinguishing words.

235

The  lectionaries  of  prime  importance  to  New  Testament  textual  criticism
are those that have Greek texts. Of lesser importance are versions, since they
are translations of the Greek, and citations of the biblical text by the church fa-
thers, since it is difﬁcult to tell when they paraphrased or roughly translated
the Greek.

8.2.1.2  Versions. Initially the New Testament was written in Greek (with a
few Aramaic words), but as the church spread, people of other regions wanted
the Bible in their own languages. The earliest translations of the New Testa-
ment, dating to about A.D. 180, are in Latin, Syriac and Coptic. In time other
regions were evangelized and the Scriptures were then translated into Ethi-
opic, Armenian, Gothic and Slavonic.  The early versions most useful to New
Testament textual criticism are those that were translated directly from a Greek
manuscript or were subsequently revised in light of Greek manuscripts. In us-
ing the versions we need to be aware of the unique difﬁculties in translating
between  particular  languages  (see  later  discussion  on  pp.  270-71).  David A.
Black underscores a second limitation:

None of the original manuscripts of the version is extant, and therefore existing
manuscripts must be subjected to textual criticism to determine the original text
as nearly as possible. In addition, in certain types of variants, some versions can-
not reﬂect what the Greek might have read. . . . However, the great beneﬁt of ver-
sional evidence is that it can show that a particular reading was known in the
place and time of the version’s origin.12

There are about 8,000 manuscripts of the Latin Vulgate alone, not to men-
tion all the other versions. Versions are to be evaluated by the same criteria as
other manuscripts—date, accuracy and independence of sources. The follow-
ing list indicates the relationship between various versions:

• Old  Latin  versions  (c.  mid-second  century).  A  primary  translation  of  the

New Testament that reﬂects a Western text family.

• Latin Vulgate (c. 382-405). Apparently Old Latin texts greatly inﬂuenced this

version.

• Old Syriac versions (c. second to ﬁfth centuries). (1) Diatessaron (c. 170): pri-
mary translation from Greek manuscripts. (2) Syriac Peshitta (c. ﬁfth cen-
tury): primary translation from Greek manuscripts.

• Coptic  versions  (c.  third  to  ﬁfth  centuries).  Both  Sahidic  and  Bohairic  ver-
sions are primary translations from an Alexandrian text, but inﬂuence from
Western texts is seen at certain points in the Gospels and Acts.

• Gothic version (c. fourth century). A primary, literal translation of a Byzan-

tine text.

• Armenian version (c. early ﬁfth century). Probably a primary, literal transla-

tion of Greek or Syriac manuscripts.

• Georgian version (c. mid-ﬁfth century). Tertiary translation, probably from

the Armenian version.

• Ethiopic version (c. ﬁfth or sixth centuries). The sources of the majority of this
translation are uncertain—the Catholic Epistles and Revelation appear to
be  primary  translations,  but  there  is  evidence  of  subsequent  inﬂuences
from Coptic and Arabic.

• Arabic versions (c. eighth century). Inﬂuences from Greek, Old Syriac, Syriac

Peshitta, Coptic and Latin versions.

• Old Slavonic version (c. ninth century). A primary translation from a Byzan-

tine text family, however a signiﬁcant number of Western readings.

8.2.1.3  Patristic citations. Patristic citations must be used with caution since
their  accuracy  is  difﬁcult  to  judge:  a  text  may  be  a  direct  quote  of  a  Greek
manuscript, or the author may simply allude to a text or quote loosely from
memory. Church fathers sometimes used several manuscripts, so citations of a
particular passage may be from different sources. The patristic citations them-
selves are merely copies, often very late, and not autographs. They too need to
be subjected to the text-critical method in order to be given their appropriate
weight. The patristic citations are extensive; it has been said that if for some
reason the New Testament were destroyed, it could be completely retrieved
entirely from the quotes of the early church fathers.

In spite of the difﬁculties and uncertainties of using patristic citations, they nev-
ertheless have importance to New Testament textual criticism, as the Alands note:

Establishing the New Testament text of the Church Fathers has a strategic impor-
tance for textual history and criticism. It shows us how the text appeared at par-
ticular times and in particular places: this is information we can ﬁnd nowhere
else. With a Greek manuscript there is no way of knowing the age of the exemplar
it was copied from, nor when we know the provenance of a manuscript (as we
do in exceptional instances) is there any way of knowing the provenance of its
exemplar, which is even more important. . . . Many important tasks challenge us
here. With more adequate information about the Church Fathers’ text of the New
Testament we would have ﬁrmer guidelines for a history of the text.13

It would be unrealistically time consuming to check all the patristic primary
sources  for  every  passage.  Fortunately,  modern  eclectic  Greek  New  Testa-
ments have already done much of this work for us. In addition, the Institute
for New Testament Research in Münster, Westphalia, Germany, and the An-
cient Biblical Manuscripts Center in Claremont, California, are dedicated to
having at least a facsimile copy of all the biblical manuscripts and fragments.
We are the beneﬁciaries of the great labor that scholars have invested in mod-
ern Greek New Testaments that include the most important information con-
cerning variant readings of speciﬁc passages.

8.2.2  Internal Evidence

Internal  evidence  is  collected  from  the  text  itself  (e.g.,  the  literary  context;
scribal habits, such as particular grammatical or spelling conventions that the
author uses; and literary forms, such as parallelism or chiasm). For example,
if the author of the Gospel of John always used the name “Christ” for “Jesus,”
but in a particular manuscript the name “Jesus” appears instead, that is a plau-
sible corruption of the text. Internal evidence also includes common copying
mistakes and intentional changes (see pp. 44-55).

Skill and familiarity with the biblical material is very useful when sorting
through the different clues within a passage that point to a particular reading
(e.g.,  parallel  units,  certain  characteristics  of  an  author,  grammatical  issues).
Among commentaries that take note of internal evidence, one of the most help-
ful is the textual commentary on the Greek text published by the United Bible
Societies.14 This work, compiled by Bruce Metzger, explains why the committee
chose speciﬁc readings for the UBS Greek text and includes the most pertinent
information for these readings. There are several editions of this textual com-
mentary, so be certain to use the one that matches your edition of the UBS Greek
text. This work can help the beginning New Testament text critic understand
the logic that professionals use in determining the most accurate reading of a
speciﬁc passage. A section in this book explains how to use the UBS textual ap-
paratus for the Greek text (see previous discussion on pp. 223-28).

It  is  helpful  to  ask  the  following  questions  when  gathering  internal  evi-

dence for determining the most plausible original reading of a text:

• Are there any spelling or grammatical characteristics that would favor one

of the readings?

• Does the author of a book or passage commonly use phrases in certain ways?

• Does the near context favor one of the readings?

Determining the Most Plausible Reading

239

• Is there a probable mechanical means that disrupted the text (e.g., haplog-

raphy, dittography, metathesis)?

• Are there similar phrases or wording in the same book or related books?

• Is there a ﬁgure of speech or parallel unit that may favor one of the readings?

• Is there an identiﬁable reason that a copyist may have changed a speciﬁc

reading?

• Is there a grammatical or theological difﬁculty?

When examining the internal evidence, record any evidence that would fa-
vor one reading over another. Often when external evidence does not indicate
a clearly superior reading, internal evidence can be used to determine the most
plausible original reading of a New Testament text.

8.3  Evaluating the Evidence

Collecting the manuscript evidence is a laborious process, but it is a little more
straightforward than the evaluation process. In the collection process the goal
is to gather as much evidence as possible concerning various readings of a spe-
ciﬁc text. In the evaluation process the aim is to determine which reading has
the  best  evidence  for  being  the  original  reading.  The  evaluation  process  is
complicated by the fact that not all scholars agree on the evaluation principles
to use or the relative importance of each of them. Table 8.2 summarizes the
four main methods of evaluating evidence.

The method used in this book is reasoned eclecticism, wherein the New Tes-
tament text critic examines all available evidence, both external and internal,
to determine the most plausible original reading of the text.15 Michael Holmes
states, “Central to this approach is a fundamental guideline: the variant most
likely to be original is the one that best accounts for the origin of all competing
variants in terms of both external and internal evidence.”16

Determining the most plausible original reading of the text is a complex task
that takes practice and skill. Over the course of time several principles have
been developed to aid the process of evaluation; they vary somewhat from Old
Testament textual principles but have similar goals and characteristics.

8.3.1  Manuscripts Must Be Weighed, Not Merely Counted

One of the most important New Testament textual principles is that manuscripts
must  be  weighed,  not  merely  counted.  Since  New  Testament  manuscript  evi-
dence is quite extensive, there must be some way to evaluate and rank their rela-
tive importance (e.g., an earlier manuscript should generally be more important
than a later one because there was less time for the text to become corrupted).
Weighing manuscripts helps to determine the parameters of a text—namely, the
possible readings of a speciﬁc text and the evidence for these readings. A great
place to begin is by collecting objective evidence for each of the various readings. 
For example: In Matthew 1:7-8 the name Asaph (  0Asa/f) is used instead of Asa
(  0Asa/). There is good textual evidence for the ﬁrst reading (â1vid, ), B, C, D(Luke),
f 1, f 13, Harclean Syriac version [in the margin] , Coptic, etc.); but there is more
evidence for the second reading, although it generally comes from a later date
(L, W, P, ª, 28, 33, 180, 565, Vulgate, etc.). In this case evidence for the ﬁrst read-
ing should be weighed more heavily because of its early date. This is not the
only information that needs to be examined, but it is a good starting point.

Since there is a wealth of New Testament witnesses, it is highly unlikely that
a conjectural emendation (e.g., a reading that is not supported by any textual
evidence) would ever be necessary, as F. F. Bruce explains:

It is doubtful whether there is any reading in the New Testament which requires
to be conjecturally emended. The wealth of attestation is such that the true reading
is almost invariably bound to be preserved by at least one of the thousands of wit-
nesses. Sometimes what was at ﬁrst put forward as a conjectureal emendation has
in the course of time turned up in one of our witnesses. For example, it was long
expected  by  a  number  of  scholars  that  in  John  19:29  it  was  not  ‘hyssop’  (Gk.
hysso4pos) that was used to convey the sponge ﬁlled with vinegar to our Lord’s

mouth on the cross, but a soldier’s javelin (Gk. hyssos). But more recently the read-
ing ‘javelin’, which was previously a mere conjectural emendation, has been rec-
ognised in the ﬁrst hand of a rather late manuscript, and it is adopted in the text
of the New English Bible; but even so it is an extremely doubtful reading.17

The  following  criteria  will  help  determine  the  weight  given  to  various

manuscripts:

• Date. The earlier the reading, the less opportunity there was for transmissional
corruption. Caution must be used here, for it is possible that earlier manuscripts
may have corrupt texts or that later manuscripts may preserve early readings
(e.g., manuscript 1739 [tenth century] has a text very similar to â46 [c. 200]).

• Accuracy. Accuracy is a function of the number of errors incorporated into a
given textual tradition. By comparing speciﬁc sources within textual tradi-
tions, scholars can determine how accurate the textual traditions are (e.g., do
they contain copyist mistakes, harmonizations, or secondary additions?).

• Independence  of  witnesses.  Witnesses  that  are  closely  related  to  each  other
should be considered as one source (as in textual families) so that they are
not  given  too  much  weight.  It  is  advantageous  to  consult  evidence  from
various geographical areas to minimize the possibility of their having been
copied from the same Vorlage (manuscript from which a later one is copied).

It is in the evaluation process that the skill of the text critic becomes vital,
for  the  various  criteria  cannot  be  weighed  equally  and  sometimes  speciﬁc
manuscripts will be given more or less priority according to their special char-
acteristics. Some sources will be weighted more heavily because they are older
or come from more accurate text families. At this point the text critic can begin
to  arrange  the  manuscripts  into  groups  or  textual  traditions.  If  two  manu-
scripts are related (i.e., copied from the same Vorlage), they should be consid-
ered as one witness so as not to skew the evidence for that reading.

8.3.2  Examine the Textual Tradition

As manuscripts began to differ from each other in the copying process, copies of
these copies began to take on similarities that can often be grouped into textual
traditions or text types. J. Harold Greenlee describes this process in simple terms:

Keeping in mind that this explanation is oversimpliﬁed, let us suppose that four
copies are made from an original manuscript and that each of these copies has its
own  distinctive  difference  from  the  original. As  further  copies  are  made  from
each of the four, each further copy will contain most of the peculiarities of the
copy  that  preceded  it,  although  scribes  might  notice  and  correct  some  of  the

changes. In this way the copies made from each of the four will tend to be more
like  the  other  manuscripts  of  their  “family”  than  like  the  manuscripts  copied
from the other three initial copies. All of them will contain the same basic text,
but the manuscripts of each of the four families will share distinctive readings in
which they differ from the manuscripts of the other three families.18

There has been signiﬁcant discussion among New Testament text critics as
to the validity and extent of using textual groups or traditions in the evalua-
tion process, but there must be some way to indicate relationships between
manuscripts  so  that  closely  related  manuscripts  are  not  given  too  much
weight. Among early manuscripts there is little evidence of textual traditions
before the fourth century A.D., primarily because all early manuscripts have
been found in Egypt (except for Ms. 0212 from Dura Europos, Syria, on the Eu-
phrates River about halfway between Aleppo and Baghdad), where the hot,
dry climate allowed for their preservation.19 But it may also be because the ear-
liest manuscripts tend to be closer to where the New Testament originated. Ei-
ther way, because most early New Testament manuscripts are from the same
general region, it is difﬁcult to speak of textual families among them.

Text types or traditions were named for the area where they were believed
to  have  developed,  the  assumption  being  that  manuscripts  from  near  geo-

graphic areas may have been copied from the same Vorlage (see map 8.1).

However, this is now known to be far too simplistic. New Testament manu-
scripts traveled very quickly to various regions of the Roman Empire and inﬂu-
ences from the known textual traditions are found in various parts of the Near
Eastern area. For instance, certain Western witnesses actually originated in the
East, including the Old Syriac version, Tatian’s Diatessaron and Codex Bezae.20
The Old Latin version arose in North Africa. Because it is doubtful that textual
traditions were well-developed before the fourth century, this criterion must be
used cautiously relative to earlier manuscripts. Figure 8.1 is a plausible repre-
sentation of the formation of New Testament textual traditions.

Figure 8.1.  Depiction of the textual transmission process

New Testament textual critics compare manuscripts within the textual tra-
ditions to see, among other things, how accurately they have been copied, the
number of new corruptions added to the texts, whether copyists tended to har-
monize  (bring  into  closer  agreement)  them  with  parallel  passages.  Scholars
then  compare  textual  traditions  to  identify  their  characteristics  and  to  rank
their relative accuracy. Table 8.3 summarizes the general consensus regarding
the textual traditions and their accuracy.

Table 8.3 Characteristics of the Textual Traditionsa

Alexandrian Group
 (most accurate)

Western Group

Byzantine Group
(least accurate)

Most of the manuscripts 
from this tradition appear 
to come from around 
Alexandria, Egypt, and 
some are very early 
manuscripts. The family 
was once thought to be a 
very carefully edited, third-
century recension (edition), 
but now is believed to be 
merely the result of a 
carefully controlled and 
supervised process of 
copying and transmission.b

This family has some very 
early manuscripts and 
comes from a wide 
geographical area, 
stretching from North 
Africa to Italy and from 
Gaul to Syria. It was much 
less controlled than the 
Alexandrian family, with 
much more variation, 
including harmonizing, 
paraphrasing and 
additions.c

This is the largest 
family, comprising 
about 80 percent of all 
manuscripts. While 
some readings may be 
early, there is no clear 
evidence for this family 
before about the mid-
fourth century.d It 
contains the most 
harmonistic tendencies, 
paraphrasing and 
signiﬁcant additions, 
most of which are 
believed to be 
secondary readings.e

a In the past it has been common to speak of a Caesarean family, especially in the Gospels;
however, it is doubtful that it is a separate text type (see Bruce M. Metzger, “The Caesarean
Text  of  the  Gospels,”  Chapters  in  the  History  of  New  Testament  Textual  Criticism  [Grand
Rapids:  Eerdmans,  1963],  pp.  42-72;  Larry  W.  Hurtado,  Text-Critical  Methodology  and  the
PreCaesarean Text: Codex W in the Gospel of Mark [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1981]; Holmes,
“Textual Criticism,” p. 128). There does appear to be some clear textual relatedness in the
Gospel of Mark, but whether it goes beyond that is unclear (see Fee, “Textual Criticism of
the New Testament,” p. 8).

e Holmes, “Textual Criticism,” 107; Fee, “Textual Criticism of the New Testament,” p. 8.

When manuscripts contain characteristics from more than one family, they
are sometimes referred to as “mixed manuscripts.” Sometimes errors in certain
manuscripts may have been corrected by comparing them with other manu-
scripts outside their text family, but it is more likely that new errors would con-
tinue to be incorporated into later manuscripts in each successive copy.

The date and accuracy of a manuscript help to determine how much weight
to  give  speciﬁc  external  evidence;  for  example,  an  early  manuscript  from  a
more accurate family would generally be given more weight when determin-
ing the most plausible original reading of a text. Table 8.4 shows the textual
families the various manuscripts belong to.

8.3.3  Determine the Reading That Would Most Likely Give Rise to the Others

Another important textual principle is to “determine the reading that would
most likely give rise to the others”; this forms the basis for the other principles. 
Several scholars consider this principle to be most important;21 if the tex-
tual critic can actually determine a logical reason why certain errors occurred
(e.g.,  haplography,  dittography,  metathesis),  then  it  may  explain  the  other
variants.  This  principle  is  particularly  helpful  when  earlier  manuscripts
clearly indicate one reading whereas later ones tend to favor a different read-
ing—a later one which text critics can plausibly determine how it could have
been  mistakenly  developed  from  an  earlier  reading.  For  example,  manu-
scripts contain the following readings for Mark 1:2: (1) “as it is written in Isa-
iah the prophet” (), B, L, D, 33, etc.), and (2) “as it written in the prophets”
(A, W, f13, Vulgate ms, Herclean Syriac, Boharic ms, etc.). The ﬁrst reading is
clearly  favored  by  earlier  manuscripts.  It  is  also  easy  to  see  why  copyists

247

would be tempted to change the reading since both Isaiah and Malachi are
quoted there.

8.3.4  The More Difﬁcult Reading Is Preferable

This principle sounds contradictory—why would the more difﬁcult reading
be preferable? This means that if a reading appears to be the more difﬁcult but
on further examination of the passage it may actually be what the author is at-
tempting to say, it should be preferred.

The reasoning behind this principle is that scribes had a tendency to sim-
plify readings. If a scribe read something that did not seem right to him, he
may have changed it without stopping to better examine the context or ﬂow of
thought. For example, Matthew 5:22 reads either “everyone who is angry with
his brother shall be guilty before the court” (â64, )*, B, Latin Vulgate, Ptolemy,
Justin, Irenaeuslat1/3, Tertullianvid, Origen, etc.) or “everyone who is angry with
2, D, L, W, D, Q,
his brother without a cause shall be guilty before the court” ()
f 1, f 13, 28, 33, 565, 700, etc.). The external evidence seems to slightly favor the
ﬁrst reading, but it is reasonable that a scribe attempted to soften Jesus’ state-
ment by adding the phrase “without a cause.” By contrast, it is unlikely that a
scribe would purposely make Jesus’ statement more difﬁcult to live out by de-
leting the words “without a cause.”.

8.3.5  The Shorter Reading Is Generally Preferable

This principle goes along with the one above—scribes tended to add things and
not remove them. The reasoning behind this principle is that copyists generally
considered the text to be the Word of God and therefore would not intentionally
remove things. Rather, the tendency was to insert additions, especially with a
view to making the text more understandable. This criterion must be used with
caution: there are occasions when a scribe made omissions either accidentally or
because the text was considered to have objectionable grammar, style or theol-
ogy. For example, there are several variants of John 16:3; the more common ones
read either “and these things they will do” (A, B, K, etc.) or “and these things they
will do to you” (D, L, Y, f 1, f 13, etc.). In this situation there is good early support
for the ﬁrst reading, and it is plausible that a later copyist may have added “to
you” to the text.

8.3.6  Determine Which Reading Is More Appropriate in Its Context

The last principle hinges most strongly on internal evidence: compare the au-
thor’s usage of grammar, vocabulary, theology and context to help determine
the most plausible original reading of the text. For example, the authenticity of
Mark 16:9-20 has been questioned for several reasons, especially on the basis
~ tw~n
of grammar and context. The phrase “the ﬁrst day of the week” (th=

sabba/twn) in Mark 16:2 is spelled differently than in verse 9 (prw/th| sabba/tou),
and Mary Magdalene is described in verse 9 even though she is mentioned
earlier in verse 1.

This criterion must also be used with caution because some of these issues
are not as clear-cut as others. For example, how a scribe usually spells certain
words is quite clear, whereas alterations made to reﬂect a scribe’s theology are
harder to identify.22

While internal evidence should be weighed strongly when determining the
original  reading  of  the  text,  it  is  still  subjective  with  few  controls.  The  best
method is to use external evidence ﬁrst to determine the strength of the readings
and then internal evidence to help conﬁrm which reading is preferable in cases
where external evidence is not clear. The best-case scenario is when external ev-
idence clearly favors one reading and internal evidence tends to conﬁrm it based
on grammar, spelling and so forth. In more difﬁcult cases we must draw on as
much evidence as possible in suggesting the most likely original reading.

While  these  are  the  main  principles  of  New  Testament  textual  criticism,
there are no across-the-board rules that dominate the text critical process. Not
every  one  of  these  principles  is  applicable  in  every  case,  and  in  some  cases
these principles may actually oppose each other. For example, the longer read-
ing  may  also  be  the  more  difﬁcult  reading,  or  the  reading  that  corresponds

TEXTUAL CRITICAL PRINCIPLES

1. Manuscripts must be weighed, not counted.

2. Determine the reading that would most likely give rise to the others.

3. The more difﬁcult reading is preferable.

4. The shorter reading is preferable.

5. Determine which reading is more appropriate in its context.

more closely to the author’s theology may indicate some evidence of harmo-
nization. Each variant must be weighed on its own merits, which is why tex-
tual criticism is an art as well as a science.

Sometimes commentaries will deal with textual variants and may be very
helpful in determining the most accurate reading of a text. Several commen-

8.4.1  Ephesians 1:1

Now we are ready to try our hand at evaluating the evidence found in the textual
apparatus in Ephesians 1:1. The textual note on Ephesians 1:1 reads as follows:

The information concerning the reading of the text will be divided accord-

ing to external and internal evidence.

• External evidence. It is helpful to ﬁrst record the date and family of every
external witness for each reading. This detailed evidence should be noted
so that each of the readings can be evaluated;  see the sample worksheet for
Ephesians 1:1 below.

• Conclusion. If we were to rely solely on the number of manuscripts in sup-
port of a speciﬁc reading, then the phrase “in Ephesus” would be included
in this verse. A more careful examination, however, suggests that there is
good evidence that this phrase should be omitted. Strong evidence from â46
(a second-century uncial, Alexandrian text tradition), and codices Sinaiti-
cus and Vaticanus (both fourth-century manuscripts, Alexandrian text tra-
dition),  favor  omitting  the  phrase  “in  Ephesus.”  Evidence  from  Marcion
(c. A.D. 170) and Origen (d. A.D. 254) also suggests that this is an early read-
ing. The fact that Marcion was considered a heretic does not come into play
since his heresies related to concepts not associated directly with this pas-
sage. It is interesting that in several sources (), B) this phrase was added by
a later corrector.

Passage: Ephesians 1:1

Which one is favored and why?
It appears that the omission is favored by earlier and better texts (at least the second 
century from good manuscripts) and that the reading e0n  )Efe/sw| “in Ephesus” cannot be 
conﬁrmed before about the fourth or ﬁfth century.

Internal evidence:
There is little internal evidence to help determine the correct reading, but the greeting is 
similar to Paul’s other letters and a location would usually be included at this point, as the 
grammar and other greetings indicate.

Conclusion
Some scholars have argued that the document had no addressee because it was an 
encyclical letter sent to various churches, the church at Ephesus being the chief. By the ﬁfth 
century A.D., the name “Ephesus” was inserted because tradition maintained that the letter 
had originally been sent there.

*Not all the external evidence needs to be included in this ﬁnal worksheet, only the most
important works.

The greeting of the book of Ephesians is similar to Paul’s other letters and
a  location  would  usually  be  included  at  this  point,  as  the  grammar  and
other  greetings  indicate.  There  would  be  an  understandable  tendency  to
want  to  include  a  location  in  this  spot.  If  one  had  appeared  originally,  it
would be fairly unlikely that a copyist would have removed it. The princi-
ple of the shorter reading generally being preferable is really not applicable
here since the evidence already given provides a signiﬁcant rationale as to
why it may have been added.

The editors of the UBS Greek text decided that the phrase “in Ephesus”
was not in the original text since it is omitted in the earliest manuscripts
(â46, )*, B*, Origen) and does not appear until about the ﬁfth century A.D.
(e.g., Codex Alexandrinus). It is interesting that some of Marcion’s works
refer to this book as “To the Laodiceans” (see Nestle-Aland text). Based on
this and other evidence, they argue that the document was an encyclical let-
ter sent to various churches, the church at Ephesus being the chief; the ap-
propriate  name  was  added  when  the  letter  was  sent  to  the  surrounding
churches. However, by the ﬁfth century A.D. tradition held that the letter
was ﬁrst sent to Ephesus, and therefore that name was placed in the letter.
The ﬁnal decision to leave the phrase but to put it in square brackets is ex-
plained in detail by the editors of the UBS Greek text in their commentary.23
Notice that the editors of the UBS Greek text rate the certainty of this read-
ing as “C.” That is to say, the inclusion of the phrase “in Ephesus” is uncer-

tain since they believe that it was not originally in the text; however, the
idea that this is an encyclical letter cannot be proved conclusively.

Which one is favored and why?
There is no strong external evidence on either side to help determine which reading is 
correct.

Internal evidence:
The internal evidence is not all that clear: vv. 5, 6 and 13-15 contain second-person forms, 
whereas vv. 1, 2, 4 and 6 have ﬁrst-person forms.

Conclusion:
This is a fairly difﬁcult decision since both readings are supported by fairly equal evidence. 
It seems most likely that the author would include himself in those who had been accepted 
by Christ, and thus the second reading makes better sense. However, it is also possible that 
the imperative beginning at v. 6, which implies a second person plural form, could have 
ﬂavored the author’s reasoning, and thus the ﬁrst reading would be more likely. The 
second person appears to be favored grammatically, since the imperative implies a second-
person form in the earlier part of the verse. Likewise, it is easy to see why someone may 
have changed the text into the ﬁrst-person plural to include the author. I therefore consider 
the ﬁrst reading to be the most plausible original reading. It is obvious from the evidence, 
however, that this should not be an “A” rating but rather at least a “B” rating, as the third 
edition of The Greek New Testament (p. 571) indicates.

• Conclusion. It is much more difﬁcult to determine the original reading of the
text for this textual variant than for the ﬁrst one. Both readings have signif-
icant external evidence and there is not signiﬁcant internal evidence to fa-
vor one reading over the other. Both forms are already used within the con-
text, but it seems unlikely that someone would change the second-person

form to the ﬁrst-person if it was there initially. However, it does seem rea-
sonable that if the second-person form was originally there, a scribe may
have been tempted to include Paul with those to whom the book was writ-
ten.  Thus  I  agree  with  the  editors  of  the  UBS  Greek  text  that  the  u(ma~j
(“you”) is probably the correct reading, but given the uncertainty of the ev-
idence I question assigning it an “A” rating.

8.5  When Should I Use Textual Criticism?

Should  textual  critical  problems  be  taught  from  the  pulpit  or  in  a  Sunday
school class? Is the modern church able to deal with this issue? Anyone who
regularly preaches or teaches the Bible needs to be aware of the area of textual
criticism: modern translations include just enough information to cause some
people to question the accuracy of Scriptures, and the King James Bible debate
is still discussed in some churches today. It is best to keep the discussion short
and to the point, dealing carefully with the issues so as not to undermine peo-
ple’s belief in the Bible or even the translation that they are used to. It is crucial
to  remind  people  that  most  variants  are  insigniﬁcant  and  that  no  doctrine
hinges on a variant text. It is also important to examine a passage carefully be-
fore you discuss it—any unresolved questions you may have will become ob-
vious to those listening. An adult education class is often a good venue to dis-
cuss textual criticism—examining the issues can greatly increase conﬁdence in
the reliability of the Word of God. If there is no qualiﬁed person, a church can
invite guest speakers who have the background to teach the principles of tex-
tual criticism and carefully explain the issues.

Getting to Know the Sources of
New Testament Textual Criticism

This chapter describes some of the manuscripts most important to New Testament
textual criticism, including papyrus fragments, codices and major collections.

Beginning with Brian Walton and his massive six-volume work, the London
Polyglot  (1655-1657),  it  became  more  and  more  common  to  list  variants  be-
tween  the  “received  text”  (in  this  case  the  Stephanus  1550  edition)  and  the
other known Greek manuscripts. This came to a climax in 1707 with John Mill
(1645-1707), a fellow of Queen’s College, Oxford, who produced a copy of the
Greek text which collected evidence from Greek manuscripts, early versions
and the church fathers. In a prolegomena to his work he described thirty-two
printed editions of the Greek New Testament and nearly one hundred manu-
scripts, as well as the important citations from early church fathers. But one of
the most difﬁcult problems to emerge with the discovery of an ever increasing
number of manuscripts and other sources for the New Testament was a con-
venient method to record them. Initially titles and brief descriptions were as-
signed to each manuscript, but this proved cumbersome, and scholars often
inconsistently assigned titles to the same manuscripts. Within ﬁfty years after
John Mill, a Swiss scholar, Johann Wettstein, was among the ﬁrst to standard-
ize designations in his two-volume Greek New Testament published in Am-
sterdam about 1751-1752. In his very simple, convenient system, uncial manu-
scripts were designated by capital letters and minuscules by Arabic numerals.
The system was modiﬁed by Caspar René Gregory, professor at the University
of Leipzig, Germany, in the latter nineteenth century, and a slightly modiﬁed
form of this system is in use today. Until a few years ago Kurt Aland, New Tes-
tament scholar in Münster, Westphalia, Germany, was responsible for ascrib-
ing sigla to new manuscripts and fragments at the Institute for New Testament
Research. This standardized system is used with great efﬁciency in the textual

apparatus (generally at the bottom of
the page) of modern Greek versions
that  list  the  manuscripts  containing
certain readings.

Of the approximately 5,500 extant
New  Testament  manuscripts,  about
116 are papyrus manuscripts or frag-
ments,  274  are  uncial  manuscripts,
2,555 are minuscule manuscripts and
2,280 are lectionaries. 

9.1  Biblical Papyri

Figure 9.1. â46, from the Chester Beatty Pa-
pyrus (II) dated to about  A.D. 200. This sec-
tion is from Romans 15:29-33. [P. Mich. Inv.

of Michigan]

All of the biblical papyri are fragmen-
tary  and are notated with a “â” followed by an Arabic number (e.g., â52, â32,
â74). A description of major collections follows.

9.1.1  Chester Beatty Collection

In 1931, twelve fragments of biblical manuscripts were discovered in a Coptic
graveyard in Egypt. They were sold to Chester Beatty, an American living in
London, and are housed in the Beatty
Museum  in  Dublin,  Ireland.  These
fragments of both Old Testament and
New Testament texts date to as early
as A.D. 200 or 250; two of the more im-
portant fragments are â45 and â46:

• â45  comprises  portions  of  thirty
leaves  of  a  papyrus  codex  origi-
nally  about  220  leaves  in  length,
including  all  four  Gospels  and
Acts.  There  are  two  leaves  from
the  book  of  Matthew,  six  from
Mark, seven from Luke, two from
John and thirteen from Acts.

• â46  This  codex  contains  86  out  of
originally  about  104  leaves  from
the  Pauline  Epistles.  Portions  of
several  of  the  epistles  are  lacking
and  may  never  have  been  in-
cluded  in  the  original  work    (see
ﬁgure 9.1).

Figure 9.2. â52 (P. Rylands 457), the earliest
fragment  of  the  New  Testament.  This  sec-
tion is from the Gospel of John 18:31-33 and
is dated to the early second century. [John
Rylands University Library]

Bibliotheque at Musée]

9.1.2  John Rylands Library

The John Rylands Library in Manchester, England, houses many notable biblical
manuscripts, including:

• â52, a small papyrus fragment (2-1/2 by 3-1/2 inches) is one of the earliest
fragments of the Gospel of John (18:31-33, 37-38) dated to the ﬁrst part of
the second century A.D. (see ﬁgure 9.2). It was purchased in 1920 by Bernard
Grenfell of the John Rylands Library, but it was not identiﬁed until 1934 by
Colin Roberts.

• Rylands Papyrus Greek i.5, known as â32, contains the text of Titus 1:11-15

and 2:4-8 and is dated to the second century A.D.

9.1.3  Bodmer Collection

Martin Bodmer from Geneva, Switzerland, founder of the Bodmer Library of
World Literature at Cologne (a suburb of Geneva), came across a collection of
biblical papyri in 1956, which he purchased for the library. Some of the more
important biblical papyri include:

• â66, also known as Bodmer II, contains a major portion of the Gospel of John
(1:1—14:26) written about A.D. 200. The ﬁrst fourteen chapters are nearly
complete, but the rest are fragmentary. There are 440 alterations and correc-
tions, most of which appear in the margins or above the text; these editorial
notations were probably made by the copyist himself.

• â72  is  the  earliest  copy  of  the  book  of  Jude;  the  two  epistles  of  Peter  are

dated between A.D. 200-300.

• â75  is  another  early  codex  containing  102  leaves  out  of  about  144  of  the
books of Luke and John, dated between A.D. 175 and 225 (see ﬁgure 9.3).
This is the earliest copy of Luke and one of the earliest for John.

9.2  Important Uncials

Uncials are designated by a capital letter in English, Hebrew or Greek, or by a
number beginning with zero.

9.2.1  Codex Vaticanus 

This codex (B in the Old Testament and 03 in the New Testament; Vatican Li-
brary, Cod. Gr. 1209) is known to have existed in the Vatican library since 1475
or 14811 (thus its name), but initially the Vatican discouraged work on it. At
the beginning of the nineteenth century Napoleon carried off this codex to
Paris with other manuscripts as a war prize, but on his death in 1815 it was

returned to the Vatican library. Constantine von Tischendorf applied for and
ﬁnally obtained permission to see the manuscript in order to collate difﬁcult
passages. He copied out or remembered enough of the text to be able to pub-
lish an edition of the Codex Vaticanus in 1867 (see ﬁgure 9.4). Later that cen-
tury (1868-1881) the Vatican published a better copy of the codex, but in 1889-
1890  a  complete  photographic  facsimile  of  this  manuscript  superseded  all
earlier attempts.

9.2.2  Codex Sinaiticus 

This codex () or S; B.M. Add. 43725) was discovered by Constantin von Tis-
chendorf  (1815-1874)  in  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth  century  at  St.  Cathe-
rine’s Monastery at the foot of Mt. Sinai, hence the name Sinaiticus. Having
been  discovered  after  other  Greek  codices  had  been  assigned  letters  of  the
English alphabet, it is designated by the ﬁrst letter of the Hebrew alphabet, )
(see ﬁgure 9.5).

The history of Tischendorf’s search for manuscripts is fascinating. In 1844
Tischendorf, a beginning lecturer at the University of Leipzig, was in the Near

East  looking  for  biblical  manuscripts.  While  studying  in  the  library  of  St.
Catherine’s  Monastery,  he  saw  a  basket  of  stray  pages  written  in  the  oldest
Greek he had ever seen. On further examination they proved to be forty-three
leaves of the LXX written in early Greek uncial script. The librarian said that the
monks had already burned two baskets of similar material in the monastery
furnace. Tischendorf was allowed to keep the forty-three leaves. In 1853 he re-
visited St. Catherine’s in hopes of ﬁnding more manuscripts, but without suc-
cess. He returned in 1859 under the patronage of the Czar of Russia, Alexander
II, ofﬁcial head of the Greek church, and by accident came across the manu-
script called Sinaiticus, a fourth-century uncial manuscript in near perfect con-
dition. Frederic G. Kenyon recounts the story:

Only a few days before he was to depart, in the course of conversation with the
steward of the monastery, he showed him a copy of his recently published edi-
tion of the Septuagint. Thereupon the steward remarked that he too had a copy
of the Septuagint, which he would like to show to his visitor. Accordingly he took
him to his room, and produced a heap of loose leaves wrapped in a cloth; and
there before the astonished scholar’s eyes lay the identical manuscript for which
he had been longing. Not only was part of the Old Testament there, but the New
Testament, complete from beginning to end. Concealing his feelings, he asked to
be allowed to keep it in his room that evening to examine it; leave was given,
“and that night it seemed sacrilege to sleep.”2

After  an  unsuccessful  attempt  to  purchase  it,  Tischendorf  returned  to
Cairo to speak with the abbot of St. Catherine’s monastery. Finally, after care-
ful negotiations and the assistance of the Czar who, as protector of the Greek
Church would help determine the next abbot of the monastery at St. Cathe-
rine’s, Tischendorf received the manuscript as a gift from the monks. In 1862
Codex Sinaiticus was published for the ﬁrst time by its discoverer, and on
Christmas  Day  1933,  the  British  Museum  bought  the  manuscript  from  the
Soviet Union for £100,000 (approximately $500,000)—the Soviet government
was  in  need  of  money,  not  Bibles.  James H. Ropes  describes  the  quality  of
this codex:

Codex Sinaiticus is carelessly written, with many lapses of spelling due to the in-
ﬂuence of dialectal and vulgar speech, and many plain errors and crude vagaries.
Omissions by homeoteleuton abound, and there are many other careless omis-
sions. All these gave a large ﬁeld for the work of correctors, and the manuscript
does not stand by any means on the same level of workmanship as B.3

[British Library]

9.2.3 Codex Alexandrinus 

This codex (A, 02; Royal MS 1 D V-VIII) has been corrected many times in the
margin, sometimes by the original hand and sometimes by a later hand, which
suggests that it was compared to other manuscripts (see ﬁgure 9.6).  In 1627,
Cyril Lucar, patriarch of Constantinople (1621-1638), offered this manuscript
to the English ambassador to Turkey, Sir Thomas Roe, as a gift to King James
I. However, it came to England in 1627 after King James had died and was pre-
sented to Charles I of England. Lucar probably obtained the Codex Alexandri-
nus while patriarch of Alexandria (1602-1621), hence its name. The codex was
housed ﬁrst in the Royal Library, then in 1757 it was incorporated into the Brit-
ish Museum, London.

9.2.4 Codex Ephraemi 

This ﬁfth-century palimpsest (C) originally bore the New Testament text and
was  reused  during  the  twelfth  century  to  copy  thirty-eight  sermons  of
Ephraem,  a  Syrian  church  father.  The  manuscript  was  apparently  brought
ﬁrst to Italy in the early sixteenth century and later to Paris by Queen Cathe-
rine de Médicis. In 1841 Tischendorf set about the difﬁcult task of deciphering

the New Testament text that had been partially erased. By 1843 he had com-
pleted  the  work,  and  it  was  published  in  1845.  Later,  scholars  treated  the
manuscript with chemicals and by use of improved photography were able
to render the underneath New Testament text more readable. They found that
Tischendorf had done admirably well with relatively few errors. Today the
codex is one of the chief biblical treasures of the Bibliothèque nationale (Na-
tional Library) in Paris.

9.2.5  Codex Bezae

In this bilingual codex (D) dating to the ﬁfth (or possibly sixth) century A.D.,
the Greek text appears on the left page and the Latin text on the right (see ﬁg-
ure 9.7). It is written in “sense lines” so that some sentences are short and oth-
ers long depending on the thought in the line. The ﬁrst three lines of each book
are written in red ink, with one column per page. The codex includes the Gos-
pels (in Western order; i.e., Mt, Jn, Lk, Mk), Acts and a short fragment of 3 John.
It was found in 1562 at Lyons, France, by Theodore Beza, successor of John
Calvin  at  Geneva,  who
it  to  Cam-
presented 
in
bridge  University 
1581  (thus  it  is  some-
times 
called  “Codex
Cantabrigiensis”).

Codex Bezae contains
many  variations  from
what  is  considered  the
standard  New  Testa-
ment  text.  For  example,
in Luke 23:53, the codex
says  that  Joseph  of Ari-
mathea,  after  placing
Jesus’  body  in  the  new
tomb,  “put  before  the
tomb  a  [great]  stone
which 
twenty  men
could scarcely roll”; and
Acts  19:9  records  that
Paul preached in the hall
of 
“from
eleven  o’clock  to  four,”
an  unlikely  time  given
the heat of day.

9.3  Minuscule Manuscripts

A  minuscule  is  denoted  merely  by  an  Arabic  number.  At  present  approxi-
mately 2,555 minuscule texts and about 2,280 lectionaries have been recorded,
generally dating to a time later than the uncials. However, it does not neces-
sarily follow that an earlier text is automatically more accurate since a later
manuscript may have been copied from a better original text. For example, mi-
nuscule manuscript number 33 is very accurate even though it was copied in
the ninth or tenth century  A.D. Minuscule manuscripts can be grouped into
families according to their similarities.

9.3.1  Ferrar Family 

In 1868 Professor William Ferrar of Dublin University identiﬁed several manu-
scripts belonging to the same text type or family called the “Ferrar Family” (or
f 13 [Family 13] since the ﬁrst minuscule is number 13). This family currently in-
cludes twelve manuscripts (13, 69, 124, 230, 346, 543, 788, 826, 828, 983, 1689
and 1709) dated between the eleventh to ﬁfteenth centuries.4 The story of the
adulterous woman, which usually appears in John 7:53—8:11 is placed instead
after Luke 21:38 in this family.

9.3.2  Lake Family

scripts 1, 118, 131, 209 (called the “Lake Family” or f 1 [Family 1] after manu-
script 1), all dated between the twelfth to fourteenth centuries. It is now recog-
nized  that  they  follow  a  text  common  to  Caesarea  in  the  third  and  fourth
centuries A.D. Manuscript 1 was one of the manuscripts Erasmus used to pre-
pare the ﬁrst Greek New Testament.

9.3.3  Minuscule 33

The excellent text of this manuscript (33) is very similar to that of Codex Vatica-
nus, and since the time of Johann G. Eichhorn in the early nineteenth century, it
has been nicknamed “the Queen of the Cursives” (see ﬁgure 9.8). It includes the
entire New Testament except the book of Revelation and dates to the ninth or
tenth century A.D.; currently it resides in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris.

9.3.4  Minuscule 16

This copy of the four Gospels in Greek and Latin, known as “16,”  is written in
four colors: the narrative in vermilion, the words of Jesus and angels in crim-
son,  Old  Testament  quotes  and  the  words  of  the  disciples  in  blue,  and  the
words of the Pharisees, the centurion, Judas Iscariot, and Satan in black.5 Pres-
ently the manuscript is housed in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris.

Examining the Ancient Versions

This chapter describes the early ancient versions of the Bible and notes their im-
portance for textual critical work. The versions are divided according to the East-
ern and Western church traditions and then by date.

Some of the earliest versions of the Bible were produced by missionaries desir-
ing to spread the Gospel into new regions, among people who spoke different
languages (e.g., Coptic, Syriac, Latin, Gothic).1 Church history conﬁrms that in
areas where the Bible is not translated into the language of the common people
(e.g., the Berber peoples in North Africa), persecution does a very thorough job
of stamping Christianity out; but in areas such as Syria and Egypt, which had
biblical translations in common languages, even the Muslim conquest in the
seventh century was not able to do away with it.2 However, by the year A.D. 600
the Gospel had been translated into only about eight languages.3 Translating
meaning from one language to another is always difﬁcult, especially between
unrelated languages. Bruce Metzger highlights several of the problems typi-
cally encountered when translating the Greek: “For example, Latin has no def-
inite  article;  Syriac  cannot  distinguish  between  the  Greek  aorist  and  perfect
tenses;  Coptic  lacks  the  passive  voice  and  must  use  a  circumlocution.”4  The
problems are far worse when the translator has only a limited knowledge of
Greek to begin with, as was the case, according to Augustine, in the fourth cen-
tury when the Hebrew and Greek texts were translated into Latin:

For the translations of the Scriptures from Hebrew into Greek can be counted, but
the Latin translations are out of all number. For in the early days of the faith every

man who happened to get his hands upon a Greek manuscript, and who thought
he had any knowledge, were it ever so little, of the two languages, ventured upon
the work of translation.5

We must also remember that every translation is interpretative to some ex-
tent, some more so than others. Despite these difﬁculties, translations can still
be of great help in determining the text of the New Testament. Each version
provides at least one author’s attempt at what he believed the New Testament
text conveyed, and since some translations are very early they may provide in-
sight into the original reading of the text.

The early church realized the importance of translating the Bible into other
languages, but these translations are not all of equal importance to textual crit-
icism.  Primary  translations  (i.e.,  translated  directly  from  the  Hebrew  and
Greek texts) are of most importance, whereas secondary and tertiary transla-
tions have at best only a limited value.

the Old Testament)

a translation of a secondary
translation, or a translation

from the Syriac or Armenian 
versions that were translated 
from the LXX)

The most important primary translations are the LXX, Syriac Peshitta and
Latin Vulgate because they have been translated directly from some form of
the Hebrew or Greek texts. Secondary translations are often helpful in deter-
mining the text they have been translated from; for example Old Latin texts are
quite helpful in determining the text of the LXX since they were translated from
some form of it. Tertiary translations are of much less value to textual criticism
because they are quite distant from either a Greek or Hebrew text; for instance,
the Georgian Version of the Old Testament appears to be a translation of the
Armenian version, which is a translation of the LXX. 

Some versions have greatly restricted value to textual criticism because the
translators had only a limited grasp of Greek or Hebrew. Some translators may

also have given quite a loose or free translation, while others a very literal one.
Versions must therefore be used with care. And yet until the discovery of the
Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947 the versions were the earliest witnesses to the Old Tes-
tament.  The  following  brieﬂy  summarizes  the  historical  background  of  the
various versions.

Of the early translations, both the Syriac versions in the East and the Latin
versions in the West are the most important for textual criticism, not only be-
cause they are so early but also because they are the basis for so many daugh-
ter translations. There is signiﬁcant debate over which of these two is the ear-
lier translation.6

10.1.1  Syriac Versions

Christ’s  followers  were  ﬁrst  called  “Christians”  in Antioch  (Acts  11:26),  the
third largest city in the Roman Empire, and Christianity spread rapidly there.
Most people knew Greek in this cosmopolitan city, but Syriac was the native
language. Thus, by the latter part of the second century at least parts of the
New  Testament  were  circulated  in  what  is  commonly  known  as  Old  Syriac
(see map 10.1).

• Tatian’s Diatessaron (A.D. 170, the earliest known harmony of the Gospels).
Tatian, born an Assyrian, came to Rome about A.D. 150, where he was con-
verted to Christianity and became a pupil of Justin Martyr. However, the
church later charged Tatian with heresy because of his highly ascetic beliefs.
He returned to Assyria and founded a group of ascetic Christians called the
Encratites (around A.D. 170). About this same time he completed his major
work known as the Diatessaron, which was a harmony of the four Gospels
written  in  Syriac.  Diatessaron  literally  means  “through  four”;  the  work
weaves  all  four  Gospels  into  one  continuous  narrative.  Tatian’s  views
emerge at times in the Diatessaron; for example, because he was a vegetar-
ian he said that John the Baptist ate “milk and honey” instead of “locusts
and wild honey.” His ascetic tendencies caused him to avoid any mention
of marriage when speaking of Joseph and Mary (Mt 1:18-19) and to remove
the phrase “when men have drunk freely” (Jn 2:10).

It  is  unknown  whether  the  work  was  originally  written  at  Rome  in  the
Greek language (the word diatessaron is Greek)7 or in his native language, Syr-
iac, but it gained popularity due in large part to Ephraem, a Syrian church fa-
ther from Edessa (A.D. 310-373), who wrote a commentary on it. Later the Di-
atessaron became so popular that it was translated into Persian, Arabic, Latin,
Old Dutch, Medieval German, Old Italian and Middle English.

• Syriac Peshitta (5th century A.D.). There are two major translations of the
Old Testament into classical Syriac (Eastern Aramaic): the ﬁrst and most
important is the Syriac Peshitta, translated from the Hebrew, and the sec-
ond is the Syro-Hexapla, translated from the Greek. For centuries several
Syriac translations, most of which were in Old Syriac, circulated through-
out Syria and competed for superiority. Around the ﬁfth century A.D., the
Syriac Peshitta emerged over the others. Its origin is uncertain, but it may
have been prepared from A.D. 411-435 by Rabbula, bishop of Edessa; some
have suggested an even earlier date since the Old Syriac Gospels adapt
some Old Testament quotations to the Peshitta Old Testament text.8 The
word peshit[ta probably means “simple or common,” referring to the lan-
guage of the common people. About A.D. 400, Theodore of Mopsuestia, an
early  church  father,  wrote  concerning  the  Syriac  Peshitta:  “It  has  been
translated into the tongue of the Syrians by someone or other, for it has
not been learned up to the present day who this was.”9 With the split of

7A third-century A.D. fragment of the Greek text of the Diatessaron was discovered in 1933 at
a Roman fort at Dura-Europos on the Euphrates River.

the Syriac church into two groups in the ﬁfth century A.D.—the Nestori-
ans (East Syriac) and the Jacobites (West Syriac)—there arose two major
recensions of the Syriac Peshitta. Some of the most important resources of
the text of the Peshitta come from the writings of several early fathers of
the  Syriac  church,  such  as  Tatian  (c.  150-190),  Bardesanes  (155-222),
Aphraates (c. 275-345), Ephraem Syrus (c. 306-373), and Ish’odad of Merv
(c. 800).

The Old Testament text of the Peshitta appears to be the work of several
hands,  each  of  which  used  different  methods  of  translating.10  The  book  of
Chronicles seems to be much different than the rest, which Samuel R. Driver
describes as “the translation of which has additions and embellishments, im-
parting to it quite the character of a
Targum.”11 The Peshitta appears to
have  been  translated  from  some
form  of  Hebrew  text  and  it  is  less
clear if it was subsequently revised
by the aid of the LXX.12 The LXX’s in-
ﬂuence  can  be  clearly  seen  in  the
word “Selah,” which is rendered in
the  LXX  as  diapsalma 
(literally
“through  the  psalm”);  the  Peshitta
merely  transliterates  this  Greek
word into Syriac. Syriac manuscripts vary signiﬁcantly concerning the order
and the books included in the Old (often included are apocryphal works—Ec-
clesiasticus, Judith and Susanna) and New Testaments (they do not include
2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, Jude, and Revelation).

The studies at the Leiden Peshitta Institute have provided some interesting
ﬁndings  concerning  the  transmission  history  of  the  Syriac  Peshitta,  which
Wolters describes:

It has become clear that this history can be divided into three stages: a ﬁrst stage
that ended with the sixth century  A.D., a second corresponding roughly to the
seventh and eighth centuries, and a third beginning in the ninth century. Most
printed editions of the Peshitta reﬂect the third stage, which is farthest removed

tions” which were ﬁrst included in the LXX and later became part of the Peshitta and Tar-
gums (“Ein Septuagintatargum,” VT 8 [1958]: 225-52).

from the MT, while the printed text of the Leiden Peshitta generally reﬂects manu-
scripts of the second stage.13

A new critical edition of the Syriac Peshitta was necessary since those pub-
lished in the nineteenth century represented the third stage of its development
and were outdated.14 This new edition of the Leiden Peshitta is based on the
Codex Ambrosianus (dating from the sixth to seventh century),15 which is the
most important manuscript of the Peshitta, but it still only goes back to the sec-
ond stage of the Peshitta’s development. Wolter’s summary continues:

But a small number of manuscripts preserve the text of the ﬁrst stage (recorded
in the second apparatus of the Leiden edition), which appears to have been quite
a literal translation of a Hebrew text that was very close to the MT. It appears that
the text of the Peshitta, through a process of inner-Syriac modiﬁcations, gradu-
ally moved away from a close approximation to an early stage of the MT. Conse-
quently  the  divergences  from  the  standard  Hebrew  text  that  are  found  in  the
third-stage textus receptus of the Peshitta are generally to be attributed not to a
different Hebrew Vorlage but to developments within the Syriac tradition itself.
In its earliest form the Peshitta attests to a Hebrew parent text that is already sub-
stantially that of the MT.16

The Syriac Peshitta is important for textual criticism because it is a fairly
early version of the Old Testament from a separate Jewish tradition, and if the
earlier  stage  can  be  determined,  it  provides  signiﬁcant  evidence  for  the  MT
text. However, the later stages of the Peshitta text have been modiﬁed to bring
it into closer harmony with the LXX and are therefore less helpful for Old Tes-
tament textual criticism.  

It is signiﬁcantly more valuable for New Testament textual criticism since it
is a very early translation from original Greek manuscripts. Thomas Nicol states
concerning the Syriac Version: “The translation of the New Testament is careful,
faithful and literal, and the simplicity, directness and transparency of the style
are admired by all Syriac scholars.”17 As mentioned above, the Diatessaron ap-
peared about A.D. 70 and in time became the authoritative gospel text for the
early Syriac church. F. F. Bruce describes its popularity:

that he collected and removed more than 200 copies from the churches in his
diocese, replacing them by ‘the Gospels of the Four Evangelists.’ This last ex-
pression probably denotes Rabbula’s revision of the Gospels. Rabbula himself
seems to have taken similar steps in his neighbouring diocese of Edessa; one of
his directions to his clergy ran: ‘The presbyters and deacons shall see to it that
in all the churches a copy of the “Gospel of the separated ones” shall be avail-
able and read.’18

The “Gospel of the separated ones” refers to the four Gospels in contrast to
the Diatessaron; by about the ﬁfth century the latter had fallen out of favor and
was being replaced by the canonical Gospels.

Modern scholars have distinguished at least ﬁve different Syriac versions
of all or part of the New Testament: the Old Syriac, the Peshitta, the Philoxe-
nian, the Harclean and the Palestinian Syriac.19 However, the standard version
in Syriac from the ﬁfth century onward was the Syriac Peshitta. Philoxenus of
Mabbug added 2 Peter, 2—3 John, Jude and Revelation into the version of the
New Testament he commissioned in 507-508. More than 350 manuscripts of
the Peshitta New Testament are known to exist today.

10.1.2  Coptic Versions

From  both  the  New  Testament  (Acts  2:10)  and  an  early  Greek  manuscript
(e.g., â52), there is very early evidence that Christianity spread to Egypt at
least by the early second century. While the Greek language had signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on Egypt, especially in the cosmopolitan city of Alexandria, native
Egyptians would probably have spoken Coptic (a corrupted form of Aigyp-
tos, meaning “Egyptian”). Coptic has at least six different dialects in the Nile
Valley (due largely to the fact that the Nile River Valley stretches for approx-
imately  one  thousand  miles  and  New  Testament  translations  have  been
found in at least ﬁve of them.) However, the two primary dialects are Sahidic
(Upper  Egypt)  and  Bohairic  (Lower  Egypt).  Since  Christianity  spread  into
Egypt so soon, versions from this area may reﬂect early traditions (see map
10.1).  The  Egyptian  language  has  a  long  history;  originally  the  Egyptians
used a hieroglyphic script that was then superseded by a hieratic and ﬁnally
a demotic script, but at least as early as the third century Coptic was the na-
tive language of Egypt. Coptic is a combination of this common native lan-
guage plus Greek loanwords, and it is written in an alphabet derived from
the  Greek  language  with  seven  additional  characters  from  Demotic  for
sounds that did not exist in the Greek language (see ﬁgure 10.3).20

While little is known about the history of the early church in Egypt before
A.D. 180-190, â52 (an early Greek manuscript) indicates that at least part of the
New Testament circulated there by about  A.D. 125. Kurt and Barbara Aland
suggest that the reason so little is known is that Gnosticism was quite promi-

nent in Egypt and thus the church there may not have been recognized by the
ofﬁcial churches until later.21

• Sahidic version (upper Egypt around Thebes; at least by the third century
A.D. since a manuscript of 1 Peter dates to that century). The Sahidic lan-
guage (from “Es-sa(id,” the Arabic name for Upper Egypt) is the oldest and
in  many  respects  the  most  important  Coptic  dialect.  It  was  spoken  from
Thebes, the ancient southern capital (modern Luxor), southward. The Sa-
hidic Old Testament is probably a translation of the Greek LXX; the New Tes-
tament, which dates to about the third century, primarily agrees with the
Alexandrian text family but contains some Western readings in the Gospels
and Acts.22

The  Sahidic  New  Testament  version  has  some  peculiarities  not  found  in
other versions: (1) Matthew 6:13 ends with “for yours is the power and the
glory forever,” instead of the more common “for yours is the kingdom and the
power and the glory forever.” (2) In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus,
Luke 16:19 records the name of the rich man as “Nineve.” (3) In Acts 15 the
Golden Rule is stated in the negative, i.e., “do not do unto others what you
would not want them to do unto you.”

• Bohairic version (lower Egypt in the Delta region; fourth or early ﬁfth cen-
tury A.D. since Papyrus Bodimer III dates to this time period). Bohairic, spo-
ken in lower Egypt, was one of the latest and most developed dialects of the
Coptic language. In time it superseded all other dialects and even shows
some inﬂuence from Sahidic. It is still spoken today in the modern Coptic
church centered in Cairo, Egypt, and until the eighteenth century was the
only known Coptic dialect of the New Testament.23 The Bohairic version is
also an Alexandrian text and is the only completely preserved Coptic ver-
sion (it is attested by several manuscripts).24

Examining the Ancient Versions

279

Egyptian Christian missionaries translated the Scriptures into Coptic in an
endeavor to evangelize their non-Greek-speaking neighbors. There are a sig-
niﬁcant  number  of  Coptic  manuscripts  and  fragments  originating  from  the
third and fourth centuries A.D. Although they show some relationship to Old
Latin  versions,  both  the  Sahidic  and  Bohairic  versions  derive  from  the  LXX;
their main contribution to Old Testament textual criticism is the light that they
can shed on the LXX text. However, Willem Grossouw, in his book Coptic Ver-
sions of the Minor Prophets, examined the Minor Prophets and found that the Sa-
hidic or the Achmimic (another Coptic version), and sometimes both, agreed
in two hundred instances with the Hebrew against the LXX.25 This raises two
questions, neither of which has been answered satisfactorily: (1) What is the re-
lationship between these two versions and the Hebrew text? and (2) What is
the nature of the Vorlage (text from which they were copied) of these two trans-
lations as compared to the LXX? Take special note of readings that do not follow
the  LXX,  since  they  may  reﬂect  an  alternative  LXX  translation  or  some  other
early reading. As regards the New Testament Coptic versions, they are a pri-
mary  translation  of  a  pure Alexandrian  text,  but  there  are  numerous  agree-
ments with Western texts in the Gospels and Acts.26

10.1.3  Armenian Version

The Armenians lived north of Mesopotamia between the Persian and Roman
empires  (see  map  10.1). Acts  2  mentions  people  from  this  region  who  were
present  at  Pentecost  (Acts  2:9  “Parthians,  Medes,  Elamites,  and  residents  of
Mesopotamia”). Christianity spread through Syria and into Armenia possibly
as early as the ﬁrst century A.D., but almost immediately would have encoun-
tered the native Armenian worship of Anahia, consort of Mithras, and Zoroas-
trianism.27 Nevertheless, Armenia was the ﬁrst nation to be ofﬁcially declared
Christian when King Tiridates III (c. 287-314), who had formerly persecuted
the church, was converted by Gregory the Illuminator (c. 257-331) at the end
of the third century A.D. Gregory was the son of an Armenian nobleman and
studied at Caesarea in Cappadocia before returning to his native land to do
missionary work. Armenia became a political and religious battleground be-
tween the Persian and Greek empires; both were determined to impose their
own religions onto the Armenians, thus threatening the very existence of the
young Christian nation.28 The Armenian Christians were strongly inﬂuenced
by works written in both Greek and Syriac, but they had no Scripture in their
own language. The ﬁrst version of the Armenian Bible was produced in the
early part of the ﬁfth century A.D. However, before the translation could be un-
dertaken, an Armenian priest named Mesrop (c. 361-439), assisted by a Greek
calligrapher named Rufanos of Samosata, developed the Armenian alphabet
of  thirty-six  letters  in  about  A.D.  406.  Shortly  afterward  Mesrop  collected
manuscripts of the Bible from as far away as Edessa and Rome and with the
help of other scholars translated them into Armenian. Mesrop was responsible
for translating the New Testament and at least the book of Proverbs into Ar-
menian; the Old Testament was ﬁnished about 410-414.29 Determining which
text was used for the original translation is still a matter of debate.

The Armenian version is one of the earlier translations of the Bible and some of
its readings may go back even earlier. It has been called “the Queen of the Ver-
sions,” not only because of its great number of copies, but also because it is a clear,
accurate and literal rendering of the Greek New Testament. The number of extant
copies of this version is second only to copies of the Latin Vulgate with over 1,244
manuscripts in whole or in part of the New Testament alone (see ﬁgure 10.4). The
Armenian version contains several books outside the biblical canon. For example,
the History of Joseph and Asenath and The Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs appear in
the Old Testament; and the Epistle of the Corinthians to Paul and a Third Epistle of
Paul to the Corinthians are included in the New Testament. More than one hundred

copies of the Armenian New Testa-
ment  stop  at  Mark  16:8  and  leave
out  the  last  twelve  verses.30  One
copy  of  the  Armenian  Gospels,
dated to A.D. 989, says that the last
twelve  verses  of  Mark  16  were
added  by  “the  presbyter  Ariston”
(who is mentioned by Papias in the
early  second  century  as  one  of  the
disciples of the Lord).31

The  quality  of  translation  in
the  Old  Testament  varies  from
book to book, with signiﬁcant de-
bate as to which text was used for
the original translation. Still, it is
one of the earliest translations of
the LXX, though in places where it
does not harmonize with the LXX
it  has  been  inﬂuenced  by  the
Peshitta.32  In  the  Old  Testament
this  version  depends  on  the  LXX
and the Peshitta, and in most cases should not be considered a separate wit-
ness. The New Testament, however, is a very literal translation that can be
quite helpful to textual criticism.

10.1.4  Ethiopic Version 

It is uncertain how Christianity came to Ethiopia (or Abyssinia, its older name);
but often scholars point to the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch by Philip
(Acts 8:26-39). Ruﬁnus, a fourth-century historian claimed that Ethiopia was
Christianized by two young men named Frumentius and Ædesius during the
time of Constantine the Great (about 330).33 While each man may have had a
part,  Christianity  was  probably  spread  through  Ethiopia  by  monophysite
monks. They ﬂed to the remote location of Ethiopia due to persecution by Byz-
antine rulers who condemned their view (i.e., that Christ had only one nature)
at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 (see map 10.1). The Ethiopic version was
probably made in the ﬁfth or sixth century in connection with the activity of the
monks. There is further evidence that these monks inﬂuenced both the Coptic
and Ethiopic churches, which largely came to be monophysite. Early Ethiopic
traditions do not appear to make a clear distinction between canonical and non-
canonical  books;  Old  Testament  apocryphal  books  are  regularly  included  as
well as several pseudepigraphal works (e.g., 1 Enoch, Jubilees, Ascension of Isaiah
and 4 Baruch).

By the ﬁfth or sixth century A.D., portions of the Bible were translated into
Ethiopic (or Ge)ez, as Old Ethiopic is called). The Ethiopic Old Testament is
probably a translation of a Greek text that has been modiﬁed at some points
by a Hebrew original.34 It also appears to have been signiﬁcantly revised by
comparing it to an Arabic version.35 The oldest extant copy of the Ethiopic Old
Testament dates to the thirteenth century and corresponds substantially with
the text of Codex Vaticanus (a fourth-century codex of the LXX), but it is uncer-
tain how this corresponds to earlier Ethiopic versions). It is difﬁcult to deter-
mine the usefulness of the Ethiopic version to Old Testament textual criticism
since it appears to have been compiled from many sources, but its major im-
portance is the light that it sheds on a text of the LXX that has not yet been iden-
tiﬁed or one that is a mixture of various forms of the LXX. Its unique readings
must therefore be considered carefully.

The  oldest  known  surviving
Ethiopic  text  is  a  copy  of  the  four
Gospels  from  the  tenth  century
(Abba Garima, MS. 1).36 It is uncer-
tain  whether  this  translation  was
made  from  a  Greek  or  Syriac  ver-
sion. According to the Alands, Acts
and the Catholic Epistles were most
likely translated from a Greek text;
however, it is difﬁcult to determine
both the languages and the sources
from which the book of Revelation
came (see ﬁgure 10.5).37

The  New  Testament  text  is  not
homogeneous and largely contains
readings found in the Byzantine or
Western  text  types;  however,  in
places a Syriac inﬂuence is evident.
The book of Acts, the Catholic Epis-
tles and Revelation are most helpful
since they seem to reﬂect some ac-
curate, original readings. The Ethiopic New Testament also includes the two
apocryphal books, 1 Enoch and Jubilees.

Independent States (formerly Soviet Union; see map 10.1). The earliest record
of Christianity’s introduction into Georgia was through a slave woman named
Nino, who was taken captive by Bakur, the pagan king of Georgia during the
reign  of  Emperor  Constantine.38  But  later  it  appears  that  Christianity  was
spread into Georgia about the mid-fourth century A.D. by both the Armenian
and the Greek-speaking church.

Georgian  language  is  an  ag-
glutinative  language,  which
means  that  it  is  built  by  com-
bining  smaller  sections  of
meaning together. It favors the
“passive  construction”  (e.g.,
“the  ball  was  hit  by  me”  in-
stead  of  “I  hit  the  ball”),  has
very few vowels, many conso-
nants  and  is  unrelated  to  lan-
guages  from  surrounding  re-
gions.  An  alphabet  had  to  be
developed  before  the  Scrip-
tures  could  be  translated  into
Georgian  (see  ﬁgure  10.6).39

10.1.6  Arabic Versions 

Arabia  stretched  all  the  way  from  west  of  Mesopotamia  to  south  of  Judea
down to the Isthmus of Suez and included one of the largest desert regions, the
Arabian  Desert.  Little  is  known  concerning  the  ﬁrst  translation  of  the  Bible
into Arabic. The ﬁrst mention of such appears in the Midrash Siphre on Deu-
teronomy 34:3, which says that the Torah was given to Israel in four languages:
Hebrew,  Greek,  Arabic  and  Aramaic.  The  rapid  spread  of  Islam  across  the
southern Mediterranean area in the seventh century forced Jews and Chris-
tians who remained in the con-
quered lands to adopt Arabic.
Since  translation  of  the  Bible
into  Arabic  was  outlawed,
Jews  and  Christians  had  to
translate  it  undercover,  and
therefore  a  number  of  inde-
pendent versions arose.
suggests 

that
translations  into  Arabic  are
numerous  and  were  made
from  Greek,  the  Old  Syriac,
Syriac  Peshitta,  Coptic  and
Latin  versions. At  present  the
oldest  known  manuscript  of
the Arabic Bible is Cod. Vatica-
nus  arabicus  13,  which  con-
tains a portion of the Gospels
and  the  Pauline  Epistles  from
the  eighth  or  ninth  century
A.D.  The Arabic  translation  of
Saadia  Gaon  (A.D.  882-942)  is
usually  regarded  as  the  last
ancient  translation  of  the  Old
Testament and is almost identical to the MT,44 but most other Arabic transla-
tions are very free renderings and are a mixture of various sources (a Hebrew
original, the LXX, Peshitta, and other versions).45 The New Testament is like-
wise a combined text. An agraphon (noted in italics) is included in Matthew

6:34, where Jesus purportedly says, “sufﬁcient unto the day is the evil thereof,
and unto the hour the pain thereof.” Since the Arabic version was derived from a
variety of sources, its greatest value to textual criticism is in the area of the his-
tory of interpretation of various texts. Spoken Arabic continues to evolve, but
written Arabic has been frozen by the language of the Qur’an. Thus the Arabic
versions are signiﬁcantly less vernacular than other translations.

10.2  Early Western Versions of the Bible

The Romans united their empire under a single language, paving the way for
the spread of the gospel throughout; the book of Acts records how the gospel
spread to this Western region. Greek prevailed over Latin in most of the Ro-
man Empire until the third century A.D., except in southern Gaul and northern
Africa, where the earliest Latin biblical texts emerged (see map 10.1). In these
two areas Latin was the ofﬁcial language of government and trade, but indig-
enous peoples continued to speak their own languages. By the third century
A.D., however, Latin emerged as the predominant language. Latin versions of
the Bible and especially the Latin Vulgate were vital to church history.

10.2.1  Old Latin Versions 

“Old Latin” is a collective term for the Latin versions in existence before the
Latin Vulgate. Gradually the West became Latin speaking; by A.D. 250 Latin
had  become  the  language  of  Christian  writers  and  theologians  so  that  soon
there  was  great  need  for  a  Latin  Bible.  Latin  translations  probably  ﬁrst  ap-
peared in the Roman province of Northern Africa (including present day Tu-
nisia, Algeria and Morocco), where Carthage had especially strong ties with
Roman culture. Tertullian (c. A.D. 160-220) quotes great sections from a Latin

biblical  text  in  his  works,  thus  a  Latin  translation  must  have  existed  by  his
time. From about A.D. 180 an outbreak of persecution against Christians took
place in Numidia (modern Tunisia), and during one of the trials a Christian
named Speratus (from the town of Scillium) was asked what he carried in a
box, to which he replied: “Books and letters of a just man, one Paul.”46

No  single  manuscript  contains  the  entire  Old  Latin  Bible,  but  Old  Latin
manuscripts, commonly notated as “it” with a superscript letter (e.g., ita, itb),
are  fairly  well  attested  for  the  New  Testament,  with  just  over  one  hundred
fragments—about  forty-six  of  the  Gospels,  nineteen  of  Acts,  twenty  of  the
Pauline Epistles, twelve of the Catholic Epistles and seven of the book of Rev-
elation.47 These fragments are by no means standardized, and they contain a
variety of different readings. Generally they are very literal translations. The
Gospels  generally  follow  the  Western  order  (e.g.,  Matthew,  John,  Luke  and
Mark). The Old Latin manuscripts from Africa diverge more frequently from
the generally received Greek text than the Old Latin texts from Europe. It is
suggested that these scribes had more freedom to incorporate their own tradi-
tions into the text rather than merely copy them.48

In the Old Testament, fragments exist from the Pentateuch, the Psalms and
the Major and Minor Prophets; more can be gleaned from works of the church
fathers.49  The  fragments  were  most  likely  translated  from  a  copy  of  the  LXX
(Joseph Ziegler calls these “the Septuagint in Latin clothing”),50 though some
passages seem to reﬂect a reading closer to the Hebrew text. 

The Old Latin texts of the Old Testament are secondary translations, but,
as Ernst Würthwein notes, Old Latin is a “particularly important witness to
the Septuagint text because it goes back to the period before the Septuagint
recensions.”51  Passages  in  the  Old  Latin  versions  that  differ  from  the  LXX
should be especially noted, for they may follow readings from an alternative
LXX tradition or other early readings. In the New Testament the Old Latin
texts reﬂect the Western text type, but some of these texts are very early and
may contain original readings. These texts of the New Testament are also im-
portant in that many are a very literal (often painfully literal) rendering of
the Greek text.

10.2.2  The Latin Vulgate 

The Latin Vulgate is very important to the study of the history of the Bible on
two counts: (1) it held a dominant role in Western Europe for about one thou-
sand years, and (2) during the Reformation, when people needed the Bible in
their  mother  tongue,  the  Latin  Vulgate  was  translated  into  many  other  lan-
guages. The Latin Vulgate was translated by Jerome during the years A.D. 383
to about 405. Pope Damasus I, bishop of Rome from about A.D. 366 to 384, com-
missioned Jerome (Sophronius Eusebius Hieronymus, c. A.D. 345-420), his sec-
retary, to revise and standardize the Old Latin version. There were so many
differences among Old Latin texts in circulation within the Latin church that
people could not be certain which text to follow. Jerome himself commented
on the great diversity of manuscripts, saying that there were “almost as many
forms of text as there are manuscripts.”52 Jerome, a brilliant scholar with a ﬁrm
grasp of Latin, Greek and later at least some knowledge of Hebrew, was called
on to rectify this problem. He considered refusing the task, knowing that peo-
ple would castigate him for changing the beloved wording of the Old Latin
texts, and wrote to Pope Damasus the following:

Is there anyone learned or unlearned, who, when he takes the volume in his hands
and perceives that what he reads does not suit his settled tastes, will not break out
immediately into violent language and call me a forger and profane person for hav-
ing the audacity to add anything to the ancient books, or to make any changes or
corrections in them?53

However, he later accepted the commission by the pope to undertake this im-
portant task.

His  work,  later  known  as  the  Latin  Vulgate  (vulgate  means  “common”  or
“plain” tongue), became the standard edition of the Bible for over one thousand
years. His most important contribution was probably the Latin version of the Old
Testament (390-405), which he translated from the original Hebrew text, being the
only one in the Western church qualiﬁed to make such a translation.54 He worked
hard to learn Hebrew; even though his proﬁciency was limited, it was better than
any other church father at the time. By the eighth or ninth century A.D., the Latin
Vulgate had ﬁnally superseded the Old Latin version. The climax of its victory was
on April 8, 1546, when the Council of Trent declared the Vulgate to be the authentic
Bible of the Roman Catholic Church:

But if any one receive not, as sacred and canonical, the said books entire with
all their parts, as they have been used to be read in the Catholic Church, and as
they are contained in the old Latin vulgate edition; and knowingly and delib-
erately  contemn  [condemn]  the  traditions  aforesaid;  let  him  be  anathema
(fourth session).55

In  general,  Jerome  chose  to  translate  his  new  work  in  a  sense-for-sense
rather  than  literal  method.56  He  explained  his  procedure  in  a  letter  to  the
pope and claimed that he only changed the Old Latin text when it seemed
absolutely necessary, and retained phrases in other cases that had become fa-
miliar to the people.57 The text of the Vulgate is not uniform—either Jerome
initially relied too heavily on the Old Latin manuscripts or perhaps he be-
came a better translator with practice. This lack of uniformity may also indi-
cate that Jerome was not able to translate the entire Bible; some have gone so
far as to question whether he actually translated a good part of the New Tes-
tament (e.g., Pauline and Catholic Epistles, Acts and Revelation).58 Nonethe-
less, Jerome used the Hebrew text as the basis for his translation of the Old

severest 

Testament,  which  was  a  vast
improvement.  But  he  was  se-
verely criticized for this by the
church, which claimed that the
LXX was inspired and therefore
authoritative.59  Some  of  Je-
rome’s 
challenges
came  from  those  who  wanted
to 
the  Apocrypha;
even  Augustine  disagreed
with  Jerome’s  Hebrew  canon.
The Apocrypha was ﬁnally in-
cluded  in  the  Vulgate,  though
Jerome  did  not  spend  much
time  on  it.  (Jerome  left  some
apocryphal  books  untrans-
lated from the Old Latin.)60 

include 

Figure 10.8.  Genesis 1 in Latin (Paris, thirteenth
century),  Vulgate  version  [Orlando,  Fla.,  The
Scriptorium, VK MS 649, fol.1r]

Because  the  Old  Testament
of the Latin Vulgate was trans-
lated  directly  from  a  Hebrew
text, it may provide insight into
the  text  at  that  time.  Jerome’s
commentaries  on  the  Minor
Prophets,  Isaiah  and  Jeremiah
(A.D. 406-420) are important to
the  history  of  Old  Testament
exegesis,  showing  how  he  interpreted  the  texts  later.  These  commentaries
demonstrate that Jerome used a variety of texts according to the reading that
best ﬁt his exegesis of the passage. In the New Testament it is more difﬁcult to
determine  the  value  of  the  Latin  Vulgate  to  textual  criticism,  since  the  Old
Latin texts signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced parts of the translation, especially in the
Gospels. In some passages, however, the Greek text underlying the translation
may precede the Byzantine text type and thus provide some very early read-
ings of the text.

59Augustine, who represented a majority of people at the time, claimed that the LXX was in-
spired (De Civitate Dei 18.43), but Jerome questioned its inspiration (Praefatio in Pentateu-
chum, in Biblia Sacra Iuxta Latinam Vulgatam Versionem, ed. Francis Aidan Gasquet [Rome:
Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis, 1926], 1:67; see also Werner Schwarz, Principles and Problems of
Biblical Translation [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1955], pp. 26-30).

10.2.3  The Gothic Version
The  ancient  Goths  (originally  from  Scandinavia)61  migrated  south  and
founded an extensive empire north of the lower Danube and the Black Sea
about the third century  A.D. (see map 10.1). During the fourth century the
empire was split in two, one on each side of the Dniester River—on the east
lived the Ostrogoths and on the west the Visigoths. During the sixth century
the  Ostrogoth  kingdom  was  overthrown,  and  in  time  they  lost  their  iden-
tity.62 As early as the third century A.D., Gothic warriors occasionally made
raids into the Roman Empire, and it was through Christian priests who were

captured as prisoners that the Gothic people began to hear about salvation.
There was even a Gothic bishop present at the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325.63
When Rome was sacked by the Goths in  A.D. 410, Augustine was relieved
that  they  had  already  been  Christianized  or  else  Rome’s  fate  would  have
been much worse.

The Gothic version probably originated with Wulﬁla (or possibly Ulﬁlas;
Gothic for “Little Wolf” [311-381/83]) who began his work by developing a
Gothic alphabet (about two-thirds Greek letters, one-third Latin letters, as
well as elements of Old German
runes [oldest known German al-
phabet]).64 Wulﬁla was born to a
Cappadocian  captive  and  a
Gothic father,65 the latter giving
him his Gothic name. However,
he spent much of his early life in
Constantinople,  where  he  was
converted to Christianity. He be-
came  a  bishop  in  341  and  re-
turned  to  spend  the  rest  of  his
life among the Visigoths in mis-
sionary endeavors.

Evidence in the Gothic transla-
tion  of  Nehemiah  5—7  suggests
that a version of the LXX was fol-
lowed. (Some think it was the Lu-
cianic text, but this is uncertain).
In  the  New  Testament  a  Byzan-
tine  text  was  used  (see  ﬁgure
10.9).    Bruce  Metzger  notes  that
Wulﬁlas  was  an  Arian  (or  semi-
Arian); that is, he denied the eter-
nality  of  Christ,  a  heresy  con-
demned at the Council of Nicea in A.D. 325.66 Wulﬁla rendered this translation
for Christians who had been captured and brought into the Gothic empire dur-
ing the third century A.D. Wulﬁla’s translation reached Spain and northern It-

have become the vernacular Bible for much of Europe.67 According to Philos-
torgius, Wulﬁla left out Samuel and Kings when translating the Old Testament
because he felt its war stories
would encourage the warring
Goths to continue to ﬁght.68 It
is  unknown  whether  Wulﬁla
ﬁnished translating the entire
Bible; only a few fragmentary
pieces of the Gothic Old Tes-
tament  have  been  preserved
(i.e., references to single words
or numbers in Gen 5:3-30 and
Ps 52:2-3; portions of Neh 5—
7), and the Gothic language is
now extinct.69 The importance
of this version for Old Testa-
ment textual criticism is mini-
mal  since  so  little  remains
(about  ﬁfty-ﬁve  verses).  This
version’s primary importance
to textual criticism is the light
it sheds on the LXX text. There
is  signiﬁcantly  more  of  the
New Testament that is extant
(about  half  the  Gospels  and
portions  of  the  Pauline  Epis-
tles); its very literal reading of the Byzantine text from which it was translated
has more value to New Testament textual criticism. However, its numerous
Coptic readings indicate either that it was edited against a Coptic manuscript
or  that  the  Greek  text  used  was  already  corrupted  by  Coptic  translations.
Wulﬁla  translated  almost  word  for  word,  even  to  the  point  of  retaining  the
Greek order over against common Gothic idiom; the result would have been
almost unintelligible to those who could not refer to the original Greek manu-
scripts.70 One of the most complete manuscripts of the Gothic version is a de-
luxe copy of the Gospels written in silver letters on purple vellum from the
sixth century A.D. It contains the complete text of Mark 16.

10.2.4  The Old Slavonic Version

During the mid-ﬁrst millennium A.D., Eastern Europe had only one Slavonic
language from which all the modern dialects derive (see map 10.1). Very little
is known about the early history of the Christian church in Eastern Europe, but
by the ninth century Rostislav, a Moravian prince, sent a letter to Michael III,
“The Drunkard” (842-867), the eastern emperor, asking for missionaries to be
sent to teach his people. The emperor conceded and sent two brothers, Meth-
odius  (815-885)  and  Constantine  (826/27-869),  to  evangelize  this  area.  They
later became known as the “Apostles to the Slavs.” The two brothers grew up
in Thessalonica, which had a large Slavic population, and thus were almost na-
tive speakers. Constantine was well educated, having completed his educa-
tion at the University of Constantinople and eventually received a teaching
position there in philosophy and theology. But about 863 he accompanied his
brother to Moravia and began immediately to train Moravians for the clergy.
Very soon afterward he devised an alphabet (Glagolitic) and began translating
the Greek Scriptures into Slavonic, as well as preaching in the same language.
A controversy arose over which language the church liturgy was to be sung in:
Greek, Latin or Slavic. Two popes ﬁnally gave permission to use Slavic, as long
as it was ﬁrst read in Latin. In 864 the Byzantines evangelized the Bulgars. The
Bulgars and the Slavs, now linked by both language and religion, developed
Slav writing.71 When Constantine died in 869 only the Psalms were completed
from the Old Testament72 and possibly the Gospels and Acts from the New Tes-

tament.73 Methodius and some of his helpers ﬁnished the work by the end of
the ninth century, but little of the text remains except for fragments embedded
in the present Slavonic Bible.74

There are no extant manuscripts from this earlier period, and those from the
tenth  or  eleventh  centuries  (Codex  Zographensis,  Codex  Marianus,  Ostromir
lectionary) display dialectical variations of the script and language (see ﬁgure
10.10). Constantine and Methodius are said to have translated the Gospels and
Acts from Greek manuscripts. After Constantine’s death, priests helped Meth-
odius translate the rest of the Bible from Greek to Slavonic, omitting only the
books of Maccabees. According to the Vita Methodii (The Life of Methodius) the
translation of the rest of the Bible into Slavonic took only eight months in 884,75
but none of it survived.

The late date of the Old Slavonic version (ninth century A.D.) means that
it has little value in determining the earliest form of the text. This version
is a tertiary translation and is of more help in determining the LXX text than
the Hebrew. It was probably translated from a Greek text in the Byzantine
text family, however it also has a signiﬁcant number of earlier readings of
the Western and the so-called Caesarean type.76 This translation is of more
value relative to the history of interpretation and the transmission of the
text in its later stages.

Conclusion

In one of my ﬁrst job interviews right after graduate studies, I was asked if I
believed Acts 7:14 to be incorrect in stating that there were seventy-ﬁve people
who went down to Egypt with Jacob (since it appears to differ from Genesis
46:27, which says there were seventy in all). At that point I did not even know
how or where to begin to answer the question, but it launched me on a journey
to ﬁnd answers to this and other questions of this type. If we believe that the
Bible is authoritative and provides guidance for our lives, then we need to be
sure of what the text says. Textual criticism is therefore crucial.

Are  the  modern  translations  an  accurate  reﬂection  of  the  original  manu-
scripts? Is Mark 16:9-20 really part of the New Testament canon, or was it added
later? And if it was added later, was it divinely inspired and trustworthy mate-
rial? Is the biblical text accurate and reliable, or has it been so corrupted in the
copying process that we cannot really know with certainty what God has said?
Textual  criticism  may  not  fully  answer  every  question,  but  a  good  working
knowledge of text-critical principles can help us begin. Textual criticism provides
the evidence necessary to compare the many and comparatively recently discov-
ered fragments and manuscripts to determine the most reliable reading of a text. 
It is important to keep in perspective the fact that only a very small part of
the text is in question—approximately 10 percent of the Old Testament and 7
percent of the New Testament. Of these, most variants make little difference to
the meaning of any passage, as Douglas Stuart explains:

It is fair to say that the verses, chapters, and books of the Bible would read largely
the  same,  and  would  leave  the  same  impressions  with  the  reader,  even  if  one
adopted virtually every possible alternative reading to those now serving as the
basis for current English translations.1

1Douglas Stuart, “Inerrancy and Textual Criticism,” in Inerrancy and Common Sense, ed. Roger
R. Nicole and J. Ramsey Michaels (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1980), p. 98. See also Shemaryahu
Talmon, who says: “The scope of variation within all these textual traditions is relatively re-
stricted. Major divergences which intrinsically affect the sense are extremely rare. A colla-
tion of variants extant, based on the synoptic study of the material available, either by a com-
parison of parallel passages within one Version, or of the major Versions with each other,
results in the conclusion that the ancient authors, compilers, tridents and scribes enjoyed
what may be termed a controlled freedom of textual variation” (“The Textual Study of the
Bible—A New Outlook,” in Qumran and the History of the Biblical Text, ed. Frank M. Cross and
Shemaryahu Talmon [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1975], p. 326).

Conclusion

299

This  does  not  diminish  the  importance  of  textual  criticism,  for  there  are
some variants that do change the meaning signiﬁcantly. The overriding pur-
pose for textual criticism is broader than this. It seeks to determine as accu-
rately as possible the authoritative, ﬁnal form of the biblical text, including the
relatively few places where the text is in question. 

At the end of the textual critical process, there is still some level of uncer-
tainty given that the oldest, extant witnesses of the Old Testament are the Sil-
ver Amulets (c. seventh century B.C.) and certain Qumran texts (c. fourth to
third century B.C.) and of the New Testament are â52, â46 (second century A.D.)
and â66, â75 (third century  A.D.). But what happened before our extant evi-
dence? 

1  Old Testament

Evidence for the Old Testament text seems to suggest that there was a “unifor-
mity even among the plurality.” That is to say, the scribes retained and pro-
tected  the  ﬁnal  form  of  the  authoritative  texts  even  though  there  are  other
forms like the LXX, SP and others that have been modiﬁed or reﬁned from their
received texts.

Tov argued for multiple authoritative texts of the Old Testament mainly be-
cause  the  parallel  passages  seem  to  demonstrate  signiﬁcant  differences  be-
tween them. But the evidence does not necessarily demand multiple authori-
tative forms of the biblical texts. The clearest example of one Old Testament
text copying another is Jeremiah 26:18, which actually states that Jeremiah is
quoting from Micah 3:12. Both are very similar, the only difference being the
spelling for Jerusalem (MIla#$
fw%rywI in Jeremiah) which is in-
fw%rywI in Micah; MyIla#$
teresting  since  neither  of  the  books  spell  Jerusalem  with  the  plene  spelling
elsewhere. Differences in the other parallel passages could reﬂect the author’s
intention to provide a rough paraphrase or to simplify or condense the narra-
tive (see for example, the LXX text of Job or Jeremiah). There is not enough ev-
idence to argue that there were several authoritative editions of the biblical
texts in existence. 

What appears more likely is that an authoritative text that varied very little
(proto-MT)  was  maintained  by  the  scribes,  then  at  some  point  other  copies
were made that either differed signiﬁcantly from this main text (e.g., the LXX
of Jeremiah or Job) or differed little at the onset but in time departed further
and  further  from  it  (e.g.,  proto-Theodotion,  Syriac  Peshitta).  Following  the
Babylonian exile it would not have been easy to continue to maintain control
over and consistency of all the copies of the Old Testament. Because of this,
multiple text forms existed by the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Sometime dur-
ing  the  ﬁrst  century,  the  proto-MT  became  the  authoritative  text,  and  devia-
tions were not tolerated by the Jews who maintained it. It is not clear exactly

how or why this happened, but the extant Hebrew manuscripts following the
turn of the century clearly demonstrate a uniﬁed proto-MT. This text was then
maintained by the scribes and Masoretes very accurately for over a thousand
years.

2  New Testament

The New Testament transmissional process was different because there was
relatively little time between the original documents and the extant copies. In
a letter to the Corinthians (c. 95), Clement of Rome says, “Take up the epistle
of the blessed Paul the Apostle,” implying that they had in their possession an
authoritative letter from Paul.2 Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna (c. 70-160), said to
the church at Philippi that Paul had written to them “letters,” implying that
they  were  aware  of  several  biblical  books.3  The  ﬁrst  mention  of  a  “written”
Gospel is found in the Didache (c. 100), which quotes the Lord’s Prayer (Mt
6:9-11)  and  then  exhorts  Christ’s  followers:  “And  do  not  pray  as  the  hypo-
crites, but as the Lord commanded in his Gospel.”4 At about the same time Ig-
natius, bishop of Antioch, states: “For I heard some men saying, ‘if I ﬁnd it not
in the chapters of the Gospel I do not believe,’ ”5 which indicates that the early
Church  knew  of  at  least  one  authoritative  Gospel.  All  of  these  quotes  and
many more indicate that the early church honored and revered their sacred
writings  and  thus  would  have  a  desire  to  maintain  them.  Even  though  the
many copies of the New Testament indicate that at least initially they were not
copied by meticulous, trained scribes, the large number of manuscripts are an
advantage when attempting to work back to the originals. 

3  The State of Affairs Today

Since the nineteenth century when the historical-critical method came into full
bloom, the accuracy of the Bible has come under constant attack. Manuscripts
or fragments of manuscripts that have been discovered in the last 150 to 200
years  (e.g.,  the  Dead  Sea  Scrolls,  the  Cairo  Genizah  manuscripts,  Codex  Si-
naiticus) can help answer questions regarding the accuracy of the Bible so that
we can have a renewed conﬁdence that the biblical text we have today is in-
deed accurate. But textual criticism cannot answer such questions as, Did the
events of the Bible actually take place? Did Moses lead Israel out of Egypt and
write the Pentateuch? Did the walls of Jericho fall down in Joshua’s day? These
are historical questions as well as questions of faith. But to begin to answer

those questions we must ﬁrst establish the reliability of the text.

It is humbling and reassuring to realize that the Old and New Testaments
have been handed down through many generations as accurately and as com-
pletely as they have. Many scribes and copyists spent countless hours copying
and checking their work to ensure an accurate text for later generations. All of
this effort was expended because they realized just how important the Word
of God is and how crucial it is to maintain an accurate record of God’s revela-
tion.  Early  copyists  and  scribes  would  no  doubt  be  surprised  to  know  that
scholars in our time would uncover some of the very manuscripts they had
written. But in fact, texts up to two thousand years old have been discovered.
Careful examination of these manuscripts has served to strengthen our assur-
ance  that  our  modern  Greek  and  Hebrew  critical  texts  are  very  close  to  the
original autographs, even though we do not have those autographs. 

There is no better way to end this look at textual criticism than as we began,

with the quote from Sir Frederic G. Kenyon:

It is reassuring at the end to ﬁnd that the general result of all these discoveries
and all this study is to strengthen the proof of the authenticity of the Scriptures,
and our conviction that we have in our hands, in substantial integrity, the verita-
ble Word of God.6
